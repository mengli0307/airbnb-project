0,2515,198,10/13/08,2603,Jenny,Stephanie was a wonderful host! Her apartment was beautiful and extremely clean. We had a very nice (and affordable!) stay in the city with private room and own bathroom.
1,2515,859,3/8/09,8455,Roland,"Such a wonderful place and very close to the metro station on the line 1 2 3. She was awesome with us, it was a pleasure to stay in her appt. she's french, so last word ...Merci encore stephanie pour ton hospitalitÃ©. On a passÃ© un super sÃ©jour avec toi. TrÃ¨s disponible pour nous avec pleins de conseils, je vous recommande particulierement cette adresse qui plus est pour un prix raisonnable. Le metro est juste a 1 bloc de l'appartement et la ligne 1-2-3 est la plus centrale et la plus pratique de NYC. son quartier est vraiment tres sympa en plus !!! Allez y les yeux fermÃ©s."
2,2515,1083,3/25/09,9759,Cem,"I just got back from a trip to NYC during which I stayed at Stephanie's appartment. The bedroom and private bathroom that comes with it were both kept very clean and are spacious so that I could unpack my stuff and put my clothes away in the closet. I didn't have to live out of my rucksack for ten days which made me already feel comfortable.The appartment is situated right at the north end of Central Park in Harlem and very close to different subway stations. I could either start my day with a morning stroll through the park and into the Upper West or Upper East Side, or catch the subway to get to Midtown, South Manhattan or Brooklyn in no time. So from a geographical vantage point the appartment is perfectly situated to discover the city.But apart from all these facts it was above all Stephanie with her warm and welcoming nature that really made me feel comfortable during these days. It is very nice to come ""home"" in the evening, tired after a long day's strolling around, and end the day with a little chit-chat about one's experiences before falling into bed and, with thumb-in-mouth, sleep blissfully through till the next morning.NYC, I will be back, and I know where I'll be staying! Thank you, Stephanie!!!"
3,2515,1107,3/27/09,9193,Holly,Stephanie's offered all the most important things: a warm welcome into a comfortable home; a comfortable bed in a quiet room; fresh & clean towels & blankets; and easy access to Manhattan.  Finding myself travelling to NYC in the future I feel I already have a open invitation to make home away from home through Stephanie's generousity.

She is the most warm hearted and interesting person and her family is the same.The whole place is clean aand as described in the ad. I'd go there again any time and thank Stph again for the wonderful stay.Thanx"
6,2515,3213,5/27/09,5889,Becca,Stephanie's apt was great. Very convenient to anywhere in NYC you would want to go. Subway stop a block away. I would highly recommend staying there if you get a chance. 
7,2515,3313,5/30/09,15342,Sarah,"my husband and i had such a great time staying with stephanie! we stayed at chez chic for 3 nights and felt right at home the minute we walked in.  the room is a perfect size, plenty of room for the two of us and a good sized closet for our suitcases, everything was immaculate, clean towels and linens, and the location is great.   not only is stephanie a great hostess, she is also a great resource for things to do in the city which made our stay even better.  i would recommend stephanie to anyone traveling to new york and we cant wait to get back to nyc to see her bed and breakfast!"
8,2515,7144,8/10/09,26899,Maria Luisa,"When I first arrived at Stephanie's, she was very welcoming! I had no problem finding my way from the subway at Central Park North and I never felt unsafe walking from the subway to the apartment (a 5 min walk)When I got to the apartment complex at 7th ave (Chez Chic)there was no elevator but there was a really friendly neighbor that helped me carry my luggage up the stairs. I met Stephanie's very nice husband and her two beautiful children and they were never a bother! And she even let me use her laptop so I can check my email and keep in touch with my family.I was free to come and go anytime I wanted to and having my own bathroom was a bonus! The bed was REALLY comfy, the air conditioning was a relief and the closet was spacious. Not too far up the street there was a 24 hour market that was awesome with a lot of great stuff to choose from so I was always able to make my own breakfast, lunch and dinner!! Going to and from uptown to midtown Manhattan was very easy and convenient with the subways running 24 hours (only a 25 min ride to Time Square) and there was always people around so you never felt alone!!Over all I really enjoyed my stay at Chez Chic and New York was a great city! I recommend any place Stephanie has available!! Enjoy your time in New York!"

13,2515,14145,10/18/09,45184,Lizzie,Stephanie was the perfect host... welcoming and generous with her time.  She clued me in to some terrific local cafes and restaurants offering delicious food at reasonable prices and venues for jazz as well.  She even helped my son find the best and safest route to an event he had planned on attending with his college friends.  Overall very professional and accommodating.    
14,2515,14349,10/20/09,35090,Aris,"I was pleasantly surprised to see a clean room, elegantly decorated in a quiet flat within walking distance from Central Park. Stephanie is very helpful and her house deserves the title Chez Chic. "
15,2515,16302,11/5/09,44089,Robert,"What a great location and welcome from Stephanie and her family! We arrived late on Friday night and Stephanie was there to welcome us. She provided excellent local information and also directions to downtown, which proved vital on the day of the marathon. The room was excellent and the bed was very comfortable, was also great to come home to a warm house very night! Living with Stephanie and her family added to our New York experience and we would recommend it to anyone.Thanks Stpehanie!"
16,2515,25151,1/31/10,68057,Niloufar,"Wow..It was one of my best trip ever. My husband and I had an amazing time in Stephanie's Place. We stayed 3 days at her place. It was a super clean apartment and we had whatever we need in the apartment, like TV,Telephone,Internet,the clean towels and well equipped kitchen. I would definitely recommend the place and the Stephanie as a host. She is so nice and very helpful. Stephanie gave us a map of NYC and great tips on where to go. Thanks a lot dear Stephanie! You made our trip!"
17,2515,25500,2/5/10,1470208,Katie,Stephanie was such a wonderful host! We were familiar with the NYC area but she went out of her way to make sure we knew how to get around her area in particular and had tons of suggestions for things to do and places to go. Everyone there was wonderful and she made us feel right at home. We had a great time and would consider her again when visiting New York City. 
18,2515,28524,3/7/10,76069,Angelica,"It is an excellent place to stay! Clean, quiet, warm, everything is close, the park, the subway..We had a great time there!"
19,2515,28930,3/10/10,80901,Ariel & Sam,What a wonderful apartment and room! We stayed for two nights at the Chez Chic and it was lovely! Stephanie and her family were away on a trip so we had the whole apartment to ourselves -- which was incredible! Her wonderful friend Sophie helped us get all set up and keys and gave us a warm welcome. We will totally stay here again next time we are in the Big Apple and hopefully we'll get to meet Stephanie and her lovely family.
20,2515,40150,5/5/10,24048,Jessica,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Chez Chic and it was absolutely fantastic! Stephanie is a very welcoming, open, and accommodating host. The neighborhood is lovely and picturesque. Stephanie has a sophisticated taste for interior design and art. (She also has the cutest kids!) The serene Central Park is down the street and the efficient subway is a block away. Our first-time stay in New York would not have been complete without this ""local"" experience.  We definitely recommend her to everyone and hope to cross paths again in the future.  :D  5 stars! Thank you, Stephanie!"

22,2515,51242,6/9/10,116704,Alice,"Stephanie and her family are warm and welcoming, offering assistance and advice without being at all intrusive. The place is clean, in a dynamic neighborhood and close to central park and transport. People who have difficulties with stairs might wish to avoid this place as there are five floors to be negotiated to reach the front door."
23,2515,59526,7/1/10,70724,Betty,"It was the 1st time my boyfriend and I were going to NYC!Our stay at stephanie's was just amazing!!!!We arrived late in the evening but stephanie was there to welcome us and give us lots of useful tips about New York!Her family is so friendly and her little son is so funny! The neighborhood is really pleasant!Her neighbors called her as we didn't have any service on our phone ! The apartment is very close to Central Park North and Harlem Meer (just a few steps to get there!)and also close to subway and bus station!She always asked us if we needed anything!You can go there with complete confidence you won't be disappointed! Trust me!Some advice if you arrive at JFK and you don't want to spend too much money in transportation:Take the airtrain to Jamaica Station and then take the A line(subway)to Manhattan.Change at 42th Street Times Square to C line uptown and stop at 110th Street Cathedral Pkwy. Then you'll just have to walk 5 or 10 minutes and you'll be there!"

25,2515,66624,7/19/10,138191,Tammy,"My husband and i stayed with Stepanie and her family at the Chez Chic Private Room for 4 nights.  The accomodations were wonderful.  Stephanie was a fabulous hostess.  We had so much privacy that it felt like we were in our own apartment most of the time.  Stephanie was great with giving us directions and recommendations of places to eat and visit.  Everything was absolutely wonderful.  The room is very quiet and clean and comfortable.  Everything is exactly as Stephanie advertises.  My husband and I left the city with a new found appreciation for Harlem thanks to Stephanie and her family.  We absolutely cannot wait to stay with Stephanie again.  We would recommend her to anyone coming to NYC!!!!!! We already have multiple times.  Thank you Stephanie, for everything!!!! :)"
26,2515,74208,8/5/10,182441,Jennifer,We had a wonderful experience with Stephanie!  Thank you!  We had our 11 mth old baby with us and she enjoyed it a lot as well.

31,2515,109011,10/1/10,119293,Sabrina,"We spent a very pleasant stay at Stephanie's apartment. Everything was just perfect: the room, the bathroom and her welcoming family! The location of the apartment is also a strength (5-min walk from the subway - main lines and from Central Park). My sister and myself recommend you this place for your future stay in NY, you won't regret it ! =) Thanks again to Stephanie !!!  "
32,2515,137500,11/12/10,185050,Gerry,"We stayed at the 111th Street apartment with Stephanie and her family. As an alternative to staying in an ""Overpriced"" New York tourist hotel, I'd recommend it to anyone. I'd stayed in NY a few times before and while this was the furthest Uptown I'd stayed, the access to transport is so easy (Ensure you buy an unlimited travel card) so no matter where we wanted to go it didn't take too long. If it's your first time in NY, Stephanie is able to advise on places to go and see."
33,2515,142514,11/22/10,232860,Flavia,Stephanie and her family are friendly. They respected my privacy and the room was as I expected. The location of the apartment is very good for public transportation and the apartment is clean. I had a calm and pleasant stay there.
34,2515,158502,12/26/10,202714,Katharina,We had a great time at Stephanies apartment - everything was perfect. The apartment is very well located.

35,2515,164671,1/3/11,329733,Corinne,"It was the firts time we used airbnb and we are very happy of this experience.  Stephanie really made us feel welcome from the first second.The house is clean, warm, very quiet and the bed is extremely comfortable. Stephanie is a very helpful and informative host. As this was our first trip to NYC we were not sure which neighborhoods would be safe to stay in. Stephanie's home is in a quiet building and my boyfriend and I both felt very safe. We highly recommend staying in Stephanie's home. What can we say? All in our stay was great and we would definitely recommend Stephanie's places to our friends and to anyone. Much better than a hotel, and probably cheaper!   It's New York a great city and Stephanie is a perfect host. Thanks Stephanie. We will come back soon."
36,2515,173011,1/21/11,41756,Katrin,"Best host I ever had - Stefanie and her family are very kind, helpful and accommodating - you will feel at home here immediately.

We had our own shared bathroom and could also use the kitchen supplies. Stephanie and her family were very open to our questions and offered suggestions on things to see in New York.  The area was perfectly located near two subway stations and close to the Harlem nightlife as well as Central Park. We can only recommend Stephanie's for any New York visitor."

Coming from South Africa where there is little or no public transport, we found it so easy and accessible and we felt totally safe.Stephanie and her family made us feel so welcome and at home and we recommend this accommodation to those who are looking for a short or long stay.

52,2515,519749,9/11/11,379695,Eric,"The room was nice and clean and conformed exactly to the description on airbnb. It was calm and the closet offered a lot of space to put away all my belongings. The kitchen and the living room can be used generously. And to have a bathroom of your own, sometimes shared with guests from the other room, is very agreeable. To be so near to Central Park and the Subway is wonderful either. And Harlem has its own special charm: It is a very varied sort of village within the Big Apple.For the lovely opportunity to enjoy this fascinating city, I'm very grateful."
53,2515,564350,9/25/11,363433,Tom,"We stayed at the Chez Chic budget room for a week. Stephanie was a great host, she respected our privacy and she provided us with information about the neighbourhood. The room is quite spacious en very clean. The bathroom is shared with other guests, but although the other room was constantly occupied, we practically never had to wait for the bathroom to be free. The wireless internet worked just fine, just as the television with digital channels. There are two subway stations at approximately 4-5 min walking distance. Lines 2,3, B and C depart form these stations. We felt safe in the neighourhood. Overall, we would definately recommend to stay at this apartment!"
54,2515,637557,10/17/11,1138528,Nils,"I went by Stephanie's place with my mother and she set up everything for us when we arrived, better than a hotel! we didn't spend much more time with her as we were visiting a lot. She make us feel being independant which is nice. We could use the kitchen in the morning. It was simple, clear efficient, close to the metro. The place is quiet, there are not so many bars around, but we went to the bier restaurant nearby which is good and serve quite late, passed 10:30pm! "

57,2515,760569,12/3/11,1358563,Katherine,"Stephanie made us feel right at home! The week we were there, another couple was renting the room across the hall, but we rarely saw them. My fiance and I spent a week here for multiple different interviews in the city, and we had no problem getting anywhere from this location. There was easy access to multiple subway lines. "
58,2515,771287,12/8/11,916462,Gloria,"Felt very welcome, comfortable and safe since our arrival.  The place was very clean, the bathroom was clean and spacious.  The room has a useful big closet and it was very quiet.  We could use the kitchen any time in the day to make tea and coffee. Being a block from central park was a real treat.  The neighborhood was interesting although there were some streets that looked rough but we didn't have any problems at all.  There are plenty of good restaurants and bars in Harlem if you want to explore the area.  I would definitely come back to stay here and I will recommend it to my friends.  "

60,2515,1013855,3/18/12,1789177,Nicole,"Spent two nights and it was perfect!  Close to several subways/bus stops and a nice, quiet neighborhood.  The room was huge and bathroom very clean (even while sharing with guests in another room).  Stephanie and her family were very kind and welcoming.  I can't not say enough wonderful things about my experience!  The only thing is beware that the building has no elevator and is a bit of a climb to the apartment.  It isn't too bad since you're not in NYC to stay in your room :-)"

63,2515,1297780,5/18/12,1767311,Laura,"Staying at Chez Chic #1 was just what I had wanted.  The accomodation were clean and quiet - the value was fantastic!  Stephanie was very patient - my plans changed multiple times; and she and Sophie were both very quick to respond to the couple of problems that arose during my stay.  Getting there by the M60 and M2 buses was fast and easy.  The location is great.  Although I didn't have a chance to go into Central Park, it was wonderful to have that greenery so close by.  There's a corner grocery store right across the street.  "
64,2515,1340850,5/24/12,2148108,Lauralee,"Stephanie and Sophie's place was great! Our schedules didn't end up lining up so we didn't get to meet them in person but they were very prompt and helpful when answering questions before our arrival. The room and apartment were very clean, comfortable and quiet! Being right next to Central Park was fantastic too. I'd recommend staying here!"
65,2515,1437748,6/8/12,2178425,Said,"This is a great place to stay when you are visiting New York. The rooms are tidy and tastefully decorated. Our room had a TV and plenty of space to store our luggage. We also had access to a fully equipped kitchen which is great if you want to cook, although you probably wonâ€™t because you will find great restaurants and markets in Harlem and in the Upper West side nearby. The subway and Central Park are both one block away and the neighborhood is safe to navigate even at night. Columbia University and the Riverside Park are just blocks away and definitely worth a visit. "

Sur ce point, nous n'avons eu aucun problÃ¨mes. L'appartement est idÃ©alement placÃ©, Ã  5min Ã  pied des mÃ©tros, de Central Park et de nombreux commerces.

We didn't have a specific time to arrive because we came from abroad, but she was very flexible with this. Arriving there, she was very kind by giving us a map from the subway and all the restaurants around and giving us tips about New York. She showed us the house and made us very comfortable staying there. We could use the kitchen, the fridge and the phone. We had wi-fi that worked normally (thank God!!!)The room was perfectly clean and organized, with AC, TV, towels, clean sheets, fan, etc.  The bathroom was very clean too. Not to mention that there are two subway stations less than a block away, which makes everything so easy. We bought a 7-day pass and in 10 minutes from the place, we were downtown. In a nutshell, I don't have anything bad to say about the place at all. Actually, the opposite. I deeply recommend staying there and if I have to go to NYC again, that's the place I will stay. "

The location of the apartment is good as being very close to main metro station and front of Central Park and the neighborhood is quite. The room is of a correct size (we are in NYC) and was clean at our arrival; just to mention that the a/c is noisy and despite the a/c and the fan in the room, we felt somehow hot (during summer).

The bed is fantastic - you'll want to sleep a bit more! We found the neighborhood safe, but some nights, when I came home late and alone, some men did bother me on the street from the subway to the apartment. Nothing serious, though - just a little annoying. Apart from that, the location is very good. We found everything we needed within 5min of walk (dining, laundry). There are two subway lines also within 5min of walk. One of them is express and takes you to Times Square in 15min.  It is also very nice to be so close to the Central Park and to take walks over there sometimes. Overall, staying with Stephanie and her family was a very nice experience.

Around the corner is a good supermarket and two subway stations are only two minutes away. It was very easy to get downtown. And of course the central park right outside the door is just amazing, especially in the summer. Clean towels were available and we had our own bath room.

130,2515,67227407,3/27/16,61961333,Stephanie,"Everything was great! Being our first time in New York City we immediately felt welcomed before our arrival and once we actually arrived. We took an early fight to NYC on Friday so we could have the whole day to explore and when letting Mizi know this before booking our flights she was more than willing to accommodate us this early. How many hotels can you check into this early? Not many. This option and Mizi's flexibility to work with us allowed us to make the most out of our time in NYC since we were only there for the weekend. Mizi just let us know to text her when we were leaving the airport so that she could be ready for our arrival. A plus is that the LaGuardia airport was only 15 minutes away! We arrived to Mizi's around 8:45am and she welcomed us with open arms. Mizi was great and the hospitality was superb. When we first arrived she informed us of our accommodations and was kind enough to sit down with us an explain where everything was located in the city. She was very helpful and directed us to the closet metros, gave us a map, told us where Times Square was, assisted us with local dining questions, and overall made our time memorable. Even though there were other people occupying other spaces within the home even they were nice! Everyone was willing to give advice and showed us a great time. While she had a family everyone was still extremely respectful and pleasant. Mizi made sure that we had an extra key to the apartment which was great in case we wanted to come in and out as we pleased. The rooms were positioned at the front of the home, so it was easy to come in without disturbing the family. We made sure our noise was limited as we respected the host's wishes, but she made sure that we were also having a good time; she even invited us to an event she was hosting in NYC!!!The neighborhood was close to many things and local restaurants were only blocks away. Harlem Tavern, which was only blocks away, is a nice place to go eat and is fairly priced too. Harlem Tavern stays open late, has a great selection of food, and has a wide variety of music that they play in the restaurant; Mizi recommended it and we gave it a A+. If we ever visit NYC again we will definitely say with Mizi. The hospitality was great and could not have been better elsewhere! The room was spacious enough for two people, had closet space, a tv, chair, trash can, etc and the apartment had Wi-Fi!!! The room and bathroom space were always clean as well!!! If you are looking for something cost efficient, in a good location, and has great hospitality check this Chic living space out!!! Thanks Mizi!!! :)"

Host is friendly and kindly provided informations and services needed, but I advice little more care about the accomodation for the future.

Aus UmstÃ_nden kam ich leider erst um 11 Uhr abends an, aber Stephanie hat auf mich gewartet und mich herzlich empfangen, trotz dass es so spÃ_t war. Da ich ihre Nummer hatte, hat die Kommunikation super geklappt. Da ich wÃ_hrend meines Aufenthalts sehr viel Sightseeing gemacht habe, war ich nur abends im Apartment. Aber ich hatte Ruhe und konnte mich dort nach dem langen Tag gut entspannen, auch wenn man vom Flur Stimmen oder Schritte hÃ¶rt. Das Zimmer und Apartment ist kleiner, als es auf den Fotos scheint, doch ist sehr gemÃ_tlich und heimisch. Das Zimmer und Bad war sauber und schÃ¶n eingerichtet. Die Matratze war fÃ_r mich ein bisschen zu hart, trotzdem konnte ich gut schlafen. Auch dass ich das Bad mit anderen teilen musste, war kein Problem. Es war immer frei, wenn ich es benutzen wollte. Stephanie ist eine sehr liebe und sympathische Frau und auch ihr Mann und Kinder sind sehr nett und respektieren die PrivatsphÃ_re ihrer GÃ_ste. Ich denke, sie sind es schon gewohnt GÃ_ste zu haben. Meinen Koffer durfte ich bis zu meinem RÃ_ckflug, auch wenn ich ausgecheckt hatte, im Apartment lassen. Ich kann sie nur empfehlen! "

I only saw the other guests like twice, but they were very nice. Mizi was really nice and gave us information about places to eat in the area, where we could do laundry, what subways and busses we can take, and where the nearest library was so my wife could do some homework on a desktop. She always kept the TP stocked up and provided a hair dryer. Her place is close to the Seinfeld restaurant (if your a Seinfeld fan), so we had Sunday brunch there (it was packed), but the food was reasonably priced. Our favorite place in Harlem was a small coffee shop called Monkey Cup. We went there because we thought it would be fun to have monkey faces on our coffee, but we were very impressed with the taste as well. Best coffee we had on the whole trip. Mizi also told us about the restaurant right across the street, we ate there on taco Tuesday. They were 3 bucks a piece. We ordered the fish, pork, and steak. They were all great."

I arrived to her house and left her place in the middle of the night, both times, but she waited for me awake the first day, and she ensured I had an appointment with a taxi service on the day of departing. The neibourghood is beautiful, excellent location and pretty quiet at nights, but safe enough. I walked alone through its streets at late hours and I can guarantee that. The bedroom is even better that it's shown in the pictures, it's absolutely clean and cozy, and so is the bathroom. This is the perfect shelter for a stay in the Big Apple, regardless off the length of the trip."

183,2595,19760,12/10/09,38960,Anita,"I've stayed with my friend at the Midtown Castle for six days and it was a lovely place to be. A big spacious room with a pointy roof, which really makes you feel like staying in a castle. The location is perfect. It is just a few steps from Macy's Time Square and Theatre District. Everything worked just perfect with the keys etc. Thank you so much Jennifer, we had a great time in New York.Attention: it's on the 4th floor without a lift :-) but definetely worth it!"
184,2595,34320,4/9/10,71130,Kai-Uwe,"We've been staying here for about 9 nights, enjoying to be in the center of the city, that never sleeps...short ways to everywhere in Manhattan, by subway or by walk. Midtown castle is a beauftiful and tastful place, Jennifer and Tori relaxed and friendly hosts - thats why we - the three Berliners - recommand that place! Good to have WiFi and a little kitchen too!"
185,2595,46312,5/25/10,117113,Alicia,We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's charming apartment! They were very organized and helpful; I would definitely recommend staying at the Midtown Castle!
186,2595,1238204,5/7/12,1783688,Sergey,"Hi to everyone!Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 2012) and will remember this time as ours best.The apartment is pretty spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner. There is everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend this apartment for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the center of the boiling Midtown!"
187,2595,1293632,5/17/12,1870771,LoÃ¯c,"Jennifer was very friendly and helpful, and her place is exactly as advertised. The location is very convenient, and it was a pleasure to stay at the Midtown Castle. I definitely recommend it :)Thanks !"
188,2595,2022498,8/18/12,2124102,Melanie,"This apartment is like a real castle old and unique. The age- related stains on the bathroom floor and dark discolorations in the carpet too indeed indicate that the building was built a long, long time ago. We werenâ€™t happy with the way the apartment was cleaned. Jennifer, the host sent in a cleaning lady right the next morning and therefore did everything she thought was appropriate to make our stay comfortable. She let us know that guest satisfaction is important to her.   After we found out that the key for the main entrance was missing by locking ourselves out in the middle of the night she was so kind to bring us the missing key within an hour. We had to leave the apartment a few days earlier because we suffered from an allergic reaction (which has never happened before and never after) related to the air conditioner as our doctor told us. The apartment is located in a great area! Subway stations are just two minutes away! The area seems quite safe although there are â€œspecialâ€ù adult video stores located in the same street nearby.  A deli/grocery store is next to the building, a 24 hours open pharmacy is across the end of the street! "
189,2595,4682989,5/20/13,496053,Eric,"Jennifer's place was in a great midtown location, close to the subway, Bryant Park and Times Square.  She met us after midnight to give us keys to the place, which we appreciated.The apartment is spacious for two people; a deli next door is perfect for last minute toiletries.Thanks for allowing us to stay!"
190,2595,13193832,5/21/14,13685934,Rainer & Gerald,Jennifer is a very nice host. Everything is clean and she really takes care of her guests. We can only recommend her apartment to others.
191,2595,15515108,7/10/14,10781357,Richard,"This is a cute studio in a wonderful location with some quirky and interesting traits including a giant translucent skylight (makes the neatest noise when rain falls on it, sounds like clapping!), warm couch, and trinkets that are fun (hoola hoops, juggling pins? sure, why not!?). Great place, great location!"
192,2595,20372242,9/28/14,4212558,Carson,"A great location, a very comfortable space and a helpful host. Everything that makes Airbnb great!"
193,2595,20937971,10/7/14,13460520,Michael,"Jennifer's place is cozy and a short walking distance from Time Square. The place was big enough for two. Jennifer left detailed instructions and was also helpful in terms of recommending great places in NY.Everything was great:)"
194,2595,21464102,10/18/14,16584002,Kitty,"We hebben genoten van ons verblijf in het appartement van Jennifer. Prima en centraal gelegen, ook t.o.v. openbaar vervoer. Het daklicht maakt dat het prettig licht is en ruim aanvoelt. Enige minpuntje is de vier trappen. "
195,2595,28794060,3/30/15,27436102,Kellie,"Jennifer was very good at communicating with us prior to our arrival. Although she could not meet with us herself, she had a friend meet with us to give us the keys and more information when we arrived. She was also very accommodating with our flight schedule and check out. The apartment was great overall, although just a little smaller than we expected from the pictures. Our favorite part was of course the skylight and dart board she had hanging. The apartment was in clean condition when we arrived, which is always a good thing!The location was amazing, close to everything, a great place to stay for our first visit to New York.  It is on the top floor, so we definitely got our workout in going up and down those stairs each day! We had a blast! Thanks Jennifer! "
196,2595,30430122,4/21/15,6429364,Sonya,"I love this space.  It is truly a gem in the heart of Manhattan.  The location could not be better.  Very clean, comfy, and great warm inviting energy.  Jennifer was very clear and responsive."
197,2595,32532759,5/19/15,12146524,Michiel,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and Jennifer really made it great! No more hotels for us in the future ;) The communication was friendly and she replied very fast. Just great!!"
198,2595,47785650,9/21/15,12885233,Lin,"Great location, in the middle of everything. The apartment is well maintained and clean. Jennifer is very responsive to texts/messages. I had a great time there."
199,2595,48764464,9/28/15,18636130,Alex,"Jennifer was without doubt an amazing host, she was incredibly kind and welcoming and made sure we had a great weekend. She supplied books and notes with all sorts of information about NY, the flat and the area. The flat is in the perfect location, not more than a 10 minute walk from Times Square and about the same distance from Penn station. The apartment itself is just as described, great for one or two people. I highly recommend the apartment and will surely use it again next time I'm in NY!"
200,2595,69547296,4/11/16,16512817,Gary,"Jennifer was an unbelievable host! Great communication and made sure I was all set for my big weekend with my college age daughter.I love all parts of NYC, but if you want Midtown, this is just about perfect. The place is sunny and bright and surpisingly little noise from the street on Friday and Saturday night. Plus, we felt very safe.Size wise, 1-2 people is probably perfect. Any more may feel a little cramped.Lastly, most Airnb places I stay feel liked they have been furnished by a recent college grad. It's clear that Jennifer lives here and was so accomodating opening up her home to us."
201,2595,173048703,7/22/17,134977148,Cory,"The Midtown Castle was a great choice for our weekend stay. It is centrally located, and walking distance for most of our stops. The apartment was clean, nicely decorated, and the perfect size for our trip. Jennifer was a great host, and made our self check-in very easy! She gave us all of the information we needed for a smooth trip.  I would highly recommend this place to other visitors, and would consider staying there again when we are back in NYC!"
202,2595,194307810,9/16/17,81450805,Marina,Tiene una ubicaciÃ_n excelente. Buen equipamiento del apartamento. Tal cual se ve en las fotos
203,2595,204069717,10/16/17,11918986,Rouel,"Jennifer is a gracious host with an amazing one of a kind space you won't find anywhere in Mid Manhattan.The perfect home away from home esp. if you're on business.Note, the stair climb is LEGIT, not fake news. Jennifer is an excellent communicator with very helpful and clear directions,The 4 flights of stairs will definitely let you know you're in NYC :)"
204,2595,207635137,10/29/17,28067322,Yannick,"Jennifer was super friendly and helpful. Great host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is walking distance! The Empire State Building, Times Square, and New York library were all around the corner or less than 15 minutes walk. Best location ever and great relaxing place to stay.Quick note: Apartment is located on the 4th floor with no elevator so make sure you donâ€™t have very heavy luggage. In any case itâ€™s a good workout :)"
205,2595,209179534,11/4/17,18840128,Nisha,"Jennifer's space was such a lovely experience. PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very clean & close to everything! Definitely be prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated that)! We enjoyed the space and location & would recommend this to anyone coming to explore the city!!"
206,2595,216355494,12/3/17,2888785,Claudia,"This is a nice apartment and it looks like in the photo. It is well located and Jennifer was very nice and super responsive! She also let me have a late check out at no extra cost, which was very kind of her. 5 stars for that! On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud. Once the heating problem is sorted out and the construction is done it will be a nice place to stay."
207,2595,217981296,12/10/17,2548115,W. Gavin,Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer is a wonderful host and was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in. We loved the apartment!
208,2595,223104380,12/31/17,110636080,Alonso,"Location Location Location.Outstanding location near to everything walking, by train or bus.We enjoy our rent there.Alonso"
209,2595,223658531,1/1/18,66056138,Blake,Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet and easy going.
210,2595,258747537,4/29/18,128182033,Natalie,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jenniferâ€™s apartment. She was very hospitable and answered any questions we had promptly. The hike up the four flights of stairs with the luggage was a challenge. The location was amazing. Central to everything, 5 min walk to the subway, close to time square. There was a bit of noise at night from all the construction happening around the apartment but Jennifer supplied us with ear plugs which worked a treat. Would highly recommend her apartment"
211,2595,265850774,5/18/18,11496712,Peter,This apartment is convenient and functional.  The huge skylight makes it feel open and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan.  Highly recommended.
212,2595,269561173,5/27/18,76998885,Laura,The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city.  Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing. 
213,2595,273575493,6/6/18,115721479,Sara,"Jennifer is very nice and responsive. The location of the apt is great. However - the bed was small and smelly. The apt also smelled weird. We had to sleep on a mattress on the floor- the building is very old. - the apt is not clean and due to construction it was very noisy. However. We do appreciate the stay and the location"
214,2595,283276097,6/29/18,51923495,Fabiola,"Jennifer es un anfitriÃ_n increÃ_ble. Siempre estuvo comunicada y dejÃ_ listos todos los detalles para que mi estancia fuera perfecta. Me sentÃ_ como en casa.El departamento es maravilloso, con mucha luz y una sensaciÃ_n de tranquilidad, ademÃ¡s de una ubicaciÃ_n inmejorable, justo en el centro de Manhattan!! A unos pasos del Empire State. Totalmente recomendable!!"
215,2595,328954829,9/27/18,203936538,Lucia,"Awesome location, spotless, wonderfully accommodating host. I will definitely stay here next time I am in NYC"
216,2595,331029784,10/1/18,174975601,Julie,The location made getting to Time Square easily accessible. Apartment was quiet and no disturbances from neighbors at all.
217,3330,23062,1/4/10,25341,David,"I haven't met Julia but her place is very nice and comfortable. The location is great - just a 15 min train ride to Manhattan. Within walking distance, there are many shops, restaurants and supermarkets. The busy main street of Williamsburg (Bedford Avenue) is just a few subway stations away."
218,3330,41260,5/9/10,114532,Francesca,Julia's room is lovely. Very light and bright. Jae made us feel very welcome and it was really cool to sit out on the roof and enjoy the view. Fantastic transport links into Manhattan. We'd definitely stay again!
219,3330,61416,7/5/10,153167,Giovanni,"We had a confortable stay. The room is really nice and bright. The location is perfect, not to busy as in Manhattan but only few stops away from the living areas. It's only 5min from Bedford av. (nice bars, restaurants and shops) and a few minutes more from Manhattan. Jae made us feel welcome and gave us good suggestions. We hope that next time we will have more time to see you and have a drink.Thanks again."
220,3330,113729,10/7/10,213554,Amaury,thx J & J for having us. it all worked out just fine. looking forward to see the Ugly Original colection on-line btw :-)  hope to meet you 2 next time! ciao for now. Amaury & Giovanni
221,3330,141726,11/20/10,250953,Denise,"Julia and Jae are the loveliest hosts I've ever had.Me and my boyfriend spent a few weeks in their apartment and it felt like we had known each other forever. The place is clean and tidy. We were free to use the living room and the kitchen. Our room was very tidy and clean upon our arrival. There was clean sheets on the bed and some freshly washed towels. The bed is super comfy. You can do your laundry downstairs in the cellar. If you're the kind of person who likes to have your privacy you will be very happy here since the hosts are at times barely at home and if they are they won't throw big parties and they will respect your privacy. However, if they are at home they will be happy to give you advice on getting around in NYC and tell you about lovely restaurants and other things to do and places to visit. The apartment is located very close to the L train so it only takes about 10-15 minutes to get into Manhattan. Jae took me to some lovely restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. We've become good friends with Julia and Jae and we'll definitely stay in touch. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING JULIA AND JAE!!! We hope to see you soon again. D&S"
222,3330,207792,3/23/11,397302,Rachel-Nicole,The host canceled my reservation 7 days before arrival.
223,3330,210675,3/28/11,380321,Anna,"My boyfriend and I spent 6 days in Julia's apartment. The apartment is really pretty and clean, as is the room; the bed super comfortable, lots of space in drawers to put away clothes etc. The subway is only 3 mins away (great!), the housemate really nice - 5 stars to ""Ugly Original"" - just a shame we never got to meet Julia herself!! Everything went very smooth, from booking to getting there to receiving keys. We highly recommend this place, and hope to hear from Julia if ever she comes to Sweden/Denmark :)"
224,3330,833806,1/3/12,993316,Maya,Julia's BK Lodge was wonderful! Great apartment in a great location. The place was clean and comfortable. We didn't see Julia during our stay but we met Julia's roommate and her dog - who we rarely saw as well. I would definitely consider staying here again to take advantage of their rooftop patio. It was a great place to call home for a week. Thanks Julia!
225,3330,15188638,7/4/14,4265869,Jeff,Awesome hosts. Awesome apartment. My own private rooftop deck overlooking Manhattan.  What more could you want?
226,3330,18669281,8/30/14,19158719,Mike And Kathryn,"Julia's place was as advertised; comfortable, in a good location, and with an outstanding rooftop. There is plenty to see/do in the surrounding neighbourhoods (e.g. great street art, excellent food) and getting into Manhattan is quick & easy.Didn't see much of Julia as we were coming and going at different hours but she was a friendly & courteous host. "
227,3330,22061861,10/29/14,14579449,Laura,The host made me feel very welcome when I arrived at the apartment. The place was really clean and the room itself was wonderful. I felt very welcome and truly enjoyed my stay there. I would recommend staying at this apartment to anyone. The area is really nice and the subway literally right round the corner! Great shops near by too. Thank you for having me for my 2 months!
228,3330,24890239,1/3/15,25128121,Daniel,"Julia and company are great hosts! The apartment is in a good location, convenient to mass transit as well as the Williamsburg bridge to Manhattan.  The room is a good size, the light from outside is lovely and the bathroom is clean with a nice bathtub/shower."
229,3330,29310974,4/6/15,2192515,Tina,"Julia's apartment was exactly like in the ad.  Her apartment was located in a friendly neighbourhood in Williamsburg, a few minute walk from the subway.  Julia provided clear directions to get to her place as well as some recommendations of local favourites. Julia's room was on the second floor of the apartment, with its own bathroom and access to the rooftop.  Her room was clean and decorative.  Julia was out of town the weekend we stayed over, but she was helpful and checked in on us even while she was away. My friend and I really enjoyed our three night stay at Julia's place.  We would definitely recommend staying at Julia's place."
230,3330,30348643,4/20/15,8859564,Jamie,"Staying at Julia's place was pretty wonderful: super spacious and clean space, amazing rooftop view of city, and a still authentic part of Williamsburg with some neighborhood gems (vegan doughnuts, artisan coffee, and a few hip neighborhood cafÃ©s/bars). Easy access to the city (metro or urban hiking), and a 24 hr. organic convenience store around the corner."
231,3330,31183185,5/3/15,16869818,Sharon,"Julia stayed in constant contact with us before we arrived at the apartment and was super friendly and helpful.  The room was exactly as described on the site and we had amazing views of Manhattan from the roof-top balcony.  We felt like it was our own private apartment as the room was quite spacious, we could make use of the balcony for breakfast and the bathroom is on the same floor and is private.  We had an awesome stay in Brooklyn and are looking forward to our next visit to NYC!"
232,3330,32512878,5/19/15,4057839,Becca,Julia was communicative and she lives in a great area. She was helpful and great to work with the entire time. Thanks Julia!
233,3330,48496996,9/27/15,22861740,Angela,Julia was a great host and she was also to show me the place before she left. The location was great and really close to the L train. The other roommates were also great. 
234,3330,52402859,10/29/15,1918105,Erika,"Julia and Jae are such welcoming, friendly people and their place is just great. We had an amazing time and would definitely stay there again!The space is huge and the view is breathtaking. Everything â€“ the room, the bathroom, the shared kitchen â€“ is clean and fresh. Julia and Jae work a lot, but when theyâ€™re home, theyâ€™re super nice to hang out with. We had a lot of fun with them and also really appreciated the list of neighborhood gems Julia sent us before our arrival and all the cool bar tips Jae shared with us. We totally fell in love with the neighborhood, which feels really safe and is close to just about everything. The subway is just around the corner and the area is full of nice bars, restaurants and more. Both Julia and Jae were really helpful and Julia gave us all information we could possibly need before our arrival in Brooklyn. Everything just went smooth! Thank you so much, Julia and Jae! We hope to see you soon again!"
235,3330,55610780,12/3/15,24206473,Gustavo,"Unfortunately we didn't meet Julia personally during our stay, but at the moment we booked her room she was very helpful and kind. We met her roommate Adriana, who's also a great person and made us feel home.The apartment is very clean, comfortable and quiet. We were impressed with the style.The neighborhood is full of services and places to eat, in a few steps. We would love to stay there again, for sure!!"
236,3330,87483258,7/20/16,1918105,Erika,"This was our second time staying with Julia and once again â€“ we loved it! The apartment is clean and just beautiful, in a cool and safe neighborhood, very close to the subway. The room is big, has a great rooftop of its own and a separate bathroom, which is perfect for us. Julia is a wonderful host; welcoming, helpful and really friendly. She let us both have our privacy and hang out with her, when there was time. We look forward to staying with Julia again! "
237,3330,93760220,8/13/16,89932,Claudia,Julia 's place is located just 2 minutes from the L train. The place has a great view over the manhatten skyline. It's clean and Julia is a great host.

240,3330,105142183,9/30/16,13302565,Ola,"We stayed at Julia's place for 9 days. The building is like 2 min walk from L subway line. The neighbourhood is safe, we were only two girls there, everyday we came home alone around 1AM and we never experienced anything dangerous. There is a lift in the building, so you don't have to carry your heavy luggage on the 4th floor ;-) The room looks nice, exactly the same as on photos. It's quite big, clean, with clean private bathroom and entrance to the rooftop. Julia is a very nice and positive person. Even though we spent whole days visiting the city, we were in touch with her via (Hidden by Airbnb) . We highly recommend that place and the NYC! "
241,3330,201559935,10/8/17,96059360,Bea,"My boyfriend and I spent a wonderful week in NYC for the first time and we decided to stay in Julia's house because the good location but, above all, for the greats reviews of the previous guests but was better than we expected!!For the first time, she was really helpful with us both before and during the us stay. The house is very nice with a great location in a cute area of Brooklyn with easy connections to go anywhere with the L train and with plenty of places around to have some breakfast (like bagles in ""Bread brothers bagel cafe"" or donuts in ""Dunn Well"", (recommended by Julia and very appreciate cause was delicious!) or launch and dinner. The bed is super confortable and the room so spacious and has a private bathroom. It has a terrace as well, from where we could enjoy the lovely views of the skyline of Manhattan. We felt extremely fortunate to have found this place and definitely, if we repeat NY at destiny, we will choice Julia's house again!!"
242,3330,204081092,10/16/17,23300977,Mathieu,"Une semaine magnifique Ã  New York chez Julia. Les indications quâ€™elle nous a laissÃ© par mail avant notre arrivÃ©e Ã©taient dÃ©taillÃ©es, complÃ¨tes et nous ont permis de passer un agrÃ©able sÃ©jour chez elle. A noter que nous avons eu lâ€™occasion de la rencontrer que le dernier jour, au moment du dÃ©part, lorsquâ€™elle rentrait de ses vacances Ã  l'Ã©tranger. Nous n'avons pas rencontrÃ© son autre colocataire, mais avons fait la connaissance d'un couple qui louait pour la semaine la 3Ã¨me chambre de l'appartement. MÃªme si nous nâ€™avons pas utilisÃ© la cuisine, celle-ci semblait fort bien Ã©quipÃ©e. Le salon est petit et joli. On accÃ¨de Ã  notre chambre par le petit escalier en fer dans le salon. Il sâ€™agit d'une piÃ¨ce accueillante et propre, grande (bien assez de place pour poser plusieurs bagages. La chambre donne directement sur un rooftop, que nous avons beaucoup utilisÃ© le soir en rentrant ou pour boire un cafÃ© le matin. Une salle de bain privative avec baignoire se trouve Ã©galement Ã  cet Ã©tage. Le quartier est trÃ¨s sympa et proche de Manhattan. Lâ€™appartement est Ã  3min Ã  pied de station la station Montrose de la ligne L. Bref, on recommande chaudement. Sauf peut-Ãªtre pour les personnes qui souhaitent se rÃ©veiller au milieu des buildings ;)"
243,3330,218427914,12/12/17,110890166,Caitlin,"If youâ€™re looking at this place; book it! Juliaâ€™s place was such a great spot! Julia was so lovely and communication was second to none! She was extremely helpful and answered any and all questions! The place was in a great spot, super close to the subway (<5mins walk), close to great food and bars/everything you could ever want/need! The place was clean and fully equipped with everything! Couldnâ€™t recommend this place enough and will be staying here next time Iâ€™m in NYC! Thanks so much Julia :)"
244,3330,247196451,3/27/18,27710096,Stella,"I spent 3 months in this amazing accomodation. Julia is a lovely, helpful and caring person. The apartment is really nice, new, clean. As well as the building. The area is the best one in the whole City of New York. Really young but also quite and safe. It is close to Union Square, that it is the center of the world, and the train stop is 3 minutes walking far. You can find everything around there: good and fashion restaurants, cheap places to get brunch, lunch or whatever with good food, groceries, shops, vintage markets. But the apartment is quite, you can get the best sleep ever, thanks to the silence and the comfortable pillows and matressess. The apartment has 3 rooms. 2 downstairs with a nice bathroom, and one (penthouse) upstairs. This one, that I rented, is huge, well decorated, with its own private bathroom and, the best part, it has an amazing view thanks to an huge terrace. Julia provides everything for your need and she is always in touch for any need. Wifi free and very fast, the living room is very nice and comfortable. The kitchen is full of everything you might need to cook.  It's impossible to leave a negative comment about her and her place. If this happens is because of dirty or unpolite guests. Because this is Just perfect.I am looking forward to come back to Nyc soon and I will stay there again. I've been more than  once in Nyc and I can tell you that this is an awesome solution for a comfortable and unforgettable stay. Thanks Julia! Love you! And I am missing you and your room already! See you soon"

I had most amazing trip in NYC and part of the reason is staying at herâ€™s! Location is super. Highly recommend."

249,3330,277103256,6/15/18,7936560,Maitreya,"We stayed at Julia's place for 5 weeks and had the best time! Everything was as described, the apartment is well equipped and very clean! The room is great with the most comfortable bed we ever slept in, a private bathroom and a big rooftop deck to yourself with impressive views. The area around the apartment is very nice , it's right next to a subway station (1 min walk) and only a few stops away from Bedford Avenue and Manhattan. Julia was great, helpful and responsive at all times. We would totally recommend this place !!"
250,3330,324255635,9/16/18,36137871,Patrick,"We had a marvellous stay in Julia's penthouse! We were there for a ten day holiday and it was the perfect place to explore New York from. The room is spacious and clean with a super comfortable bed and space to hang clothes and store belongings, and lots of power outlets to charge devices. The bathroom has a powerful shower which was always hot and the balcony has incredible panoramic views of Manhattan.We experienced all weather on our trip (torrential rain, fog, high humidity and glorious sunshine) and the room remained temperate at all times. Also surprisingly quiet considering it's in the middle of a big city. We felt safe and secure there throughout our stay and Julia's housemates were really welcoming. It's perfectly located with the subway just around the corner to take you straight into Manhattan and fun areas nearby in Brooklyn. Communication with the host was great, checking in and out was very easy and Julia provided lots of detailed instructions and great tips for places to eat and explore nearby. Julia very kindly left some umbrellas out for us to use when we mentioned it was likely to rain on our trip, which was a thoughtful touch.We would definitely love to stay here again next time we're in NYC and highly recommend it to anyone else coming to the city."

252,3831,22232975,11/2/14,6050386,Monica,"The best thing about this place is the location! You're right in the middle of Clinton Hill with easy access to restaurants on Franklin Avenue and in Fort Greene. You're also close to the C and G trains, so transportation is easy. The space is clean and neat, if spare. It really is much more of a one-floor apartment than a private room, as you will only have interactions with the family on the shared stairs and stoop. There is, however, no door at the top of the stairs so sounds travel from the rest of the house. Lisa-Roxanne was kind and accommodating, and the children are adorable!"

The room is fine, spacious if spare but that  is clear from the pictures. There were a lot of thoughtful details as well, like spare toothbrushes, coffee, creamer etc. One of the things I was worried about in NYC was parking, and there was plenty of on street parking. There was a market on the corner. The house is currently being renovated so chances are you will find it even better when you go. My wife and I had a great time, she especially loved her surprise! "

But the place is very clean and tidy, the bed sleeps wonderful and LisaRoxanne and her husband are wonderful people doing all they can to make you feel comfortable. Special plus for us: We had our one-and-a-half-year-old kid with us and that was no problem whatsoever. If you go to NYC, stay there - you are in the best hands!"

The space was clean and neighborhood felt safe.  On-street parking was plentiful on the weekend.  She and her family were there throughout the time we were there and being on the top floor there was enough separation and privacy that it was not a problem.  She was very accommodating and gracious when we had a last minute addition, needing an additional bed.  Great value --  I highly recommend!"

279,3831,56589139,12/15/15,8741356,Martin,"I quickly felt at home in Lisa Roxanne's home. The top floor is part of the house but I always felt that I had privacy and could get on with what I had to do. Anything that I felt missing in the kitchen was quickly organised as soon as I asked for it. Lisa responds extremely quickly to any message on AirBnb and helps with the issues that comes up. She did call me a car service this morning for me to go to JFK. Very helpful!The area is up and coming and has good restaurants and a nice vibe. I would live there again without hesitation."

The accommodation was perfect 2 beds and a comfy cot which fit 3 people in the top floor of the 3 story brownstone, there was a kitchen which included a stove, microwave and refrigerator as well as a dining table to sit and eat. The bathroom was very clean and Lisa provide us with towels, toothbrushes and toothpaste as well as soap and shampoo in the shower which was very thoughtful.

The neighborhood was as described and I never felt unsafe walking around at anytime. Lisa also gave us a guidebook of restaurants and bars to try in the area that proved to be very helpful. We met new people at most of the places we went to. Manhattan is about a 40 minute subway ride so plan for that if you do decide to stay here.
284,3831,58851986,1/5/16,35253952,Matthew,"The location is great, 6 blocks to two different subway stops/trains that's less than 30 mins to Manhattan. Neighborhood is pretty quiet and many places being updated in the area. I was a little apprehensive about the arrangement of sharing a house but the layout of the house is such it's not an issue. This is a great value with the kitchen. Lisa made sure we had directions from the airport, which were perfect. I'd recommend staying here. "

The quarter was safe and the people were very friendly. Supermarket and restaurants were near.The apartment was very clean and there was coffee, coffee filter, iron and a hairdryer. Lisa Roxanne and her family are lovely people. She was very helpful and gave good tips. On our next visit to New York we will be happy to stay there again.At birthday, there was a very great cake. it was a big surprise.Lisa Roxanne and her family are great people."

312,3831,76748722,5/29/16,7039087,Kirill,We stayed only for one night and are well rested before the flight. LisaRoxanne did everything to make us feel at home. Thanks for the hospitality!
313,3831,77539468,6/1/16,27182932,Roy,"We had a great stay here! We had all the amenities we needed. It was a warm week in New York, but there was a fan that we were able to use to keep the space cool. The neighborhood was very nice and it was an easy walk to some great bakeries and the subway. "
314,3831,78602436,6/7/16,24518187,Rachel,"This place is fantastic, LisaRoxanne was an exceptional host and was very helpful with providing information including directions and recommendations for restaurants.  The private floor is essentially it's own apartment with all of the amenities you need, the neighborhood is lovely and quiet and has great restaurants and is close enough to public transportation to make everything pretty accessible.  We had a great stay and would definitely return! "
315,3831,80500310,6/18/16,19847715,France,"Lisa Roxanne nous a trÃ¨s bien reÃ§us. Elle est trÃ¨s serviable et a pris le temps de nous expliquer comment aller Ã  Manhattan. Elle nous a mÃªme imprimÃ© des itinÃ©raires. Il faut compter 30 Ã  40 minutes pour rejoindre Manhattan. Le mÃ©tro est Ã  10 min. Ã  pied du logement. Le quartier oÃ_ se situe le logement est agrÃ©able, de trÃ¨s belles maisons dans le coin."
316,3831,81716748,6/24/16,33102130,Tamas,"We felt welcome and treated well. Neighbourhood is listed officially not very safe but we didn't have any issues with people on the streets. It's quite relaxed family oriented area, churches and schools around.The apartment has everything one would need from such place to rent.The bed was really comfy, even better than in most of the hotels we have ever stayed and let's face it that is the most important part.Our discomfort was the smell of cigarettes that came up from downstairs and that the floor is only separated by stairs so the noise of the kids and constantly ongoing TV feels very present and not private at all as it makes you feel that your average activities are just as audible for your hosts as they are for you. Not romantic at all if you know what I mean...In over all it was a good stay but only recommend it if you want to be out most of the time and you need a place that has absolutely everything for the short time you spend there in the evenings and mornings. 4 stars from me."
317,3831,84175631,7/5/16,2099743,Angel,We had a good time staying at LisaRoxanne's place. We didn't spend too much time in the apartment but the stay was pleasant. She was very good at communicating and even set up the rollaway bed for my friend. The apartment is just as pictured and has all the amenities that you'll need. 
318,3831,85877370,7/13/16,2099230,Gonda,"LisaRoxanne was at home when we arrived and helped us with everything, including infomation to the neighborhood. The house is in a quiet street close to the subway and right next to a bus stop.Our room (with a/c) with private bathroom (towels, toothpaste, shampoo.. was provided) and kitchen was upstairs. But if you are able (like us) to walk some steps it is the perfect place to stay. Since part of the subway was under construction during our stay, we sometimes took the bus to a bigger subway station (Jay or Hoyt).Lisa Roxanne provided us the most beautiful birthday cake with pictures of the skyline of Manhanttan. Thanks again.LisaRoxanne can organize transprotation from and to the airport. We didn't need it this time, but this can be very helpful. "

Lisa Ã¨ sempre stata disponibile a darci informazioni e verso le nostre esigenze. L alloggio Ã¨ funzionale e pulito. Si accede attraverso una scala un Po stretta,(se si hanno problemi di mobilita potrebbe essere un problema) ma noi non abbiamo avuto problemi. Il  bagno Ã¨ nuovo appena ristrutturato. La cucina Ã¨ funzionante con l occorrente per preparare un semplice pasto. I letti sono comodi e le stanze abbastanza grandi dove mettere le valigie e i vestiti. Lenzuola e asciugamani puliti e in ottimo stato.Per correttezza di recensione senza nulla togliere l'alloggio, nelle foto sembra migliore con rifiniture piÃ_ accurate, ma ripeto pulito e funzionale. L aria condizionata funziona a dovere e il WI FI  funzionale benissimo. Il quartiere sembra un Po trascurato, ma sembra sicuro,noi siamo rientrati anche a tarda sera senza mai avere sensazioni di pericolo o insicurezza. Nelle vicinanze sulla Franklin vi sono supermercati, negli isolati adiacenti vi sono piccoli negoziati aperti fino a tardi. La metropolitana si trova a 10 minuti. Nei dintorni vi sono diverse linee di bus. Ringraziamo Lisa per l ospitalitÃ . Ci torneremo e lo consiglierei ad amici che vogliano visitare NY senza spendere una fortuna consapevoli di non essere in un hotel a 4 stelle. Consigliato "
325,3831,100031098,9/7/16,69171173,Cassandra,Nice place with access to Metro bus within feet of the front door. Friendly neighborhood with plenty of places to eat or shop within walking distance.

327,3831,103161516,9/20/16,5642090,David,LisaRoxanne was very accommodating. We like being in a non-tourist neighborhood and this fit the bill.  Glad there is an air conditioner in the bedroom!

329,3831,106031325,10/3/16,52909749,Ed,"LisaRoxanne met us when we arrived and gave us our keys - she showed us around and then let us be, which was just great. LisaRoxanne gave us privacy and we came & went as we pleased. The neighbourhood is great with lots of local food options - however it is on the flight path & the buses make it a bit noisy. We also hadn't realised that the trip in/out of Manhatten each day was fairly time consuming - in essence it gave us a great opportunity to see 'normal' life & we would never have gone to Brooklyn otherwise - which we really enjoyed - however as 'tourists' it was a trek in/out of the cityThe accommodation was perfectly adequate for what we needed - good amenities - lisaRoxanne even thought to leave us a couple of umbrellas which was well appreciated - eating in would have been really easy but with NYC on the doorstep, why would you? Thanks & goodluck LisaRoxanne "
330,3831,106175332,10/4/16,77750040,Annje,"Alles war supersauber und nett hergerichtet. Die Nachbarschaft ist gemischt, teilweise chic, teilweise weniger, aber nicht unsicher. Perfekte Lage zur U-Bahn ca. 5 Min. Guter BÃ_cker azf dem Weg dorthin."
331,3831,106737495,10/7/16,6661413,Laura,"We had a great stay at LisaRoxanne's place when we stayed for 3 nights in October. The apartment is relatively well located for the subway (less than 10 mins walk) and was equipped as shown in the pictures. Short walk to a few coffee shops/restaurants/bars. The living area had a good wifi connection, the bed was big and comfy and the bedroom was very spacious with A/C.  The only thing to bear in mind, as another reviewer has noted, is that even though the guest area occupies the whole of the top floor of the building there is no dividing wall or door for the area - other than the bedroom door.  This doesn't cause any major problems but it does mean that noise from the family living area below travels up the stairs more easily and has a feeling of the area not being completely private - although this was just a feeling as we had sole use of the top floor. LisaRoxanne was a friendly and responsive host before and during our stay."
332,3831,107304979,10/9/16,21232644,Steve,"Super great location for our needsThe space was wide open and offered everything we needed would stay again"

Lisa was kind enough to call us a taxi and recommend a play for us. She even took the time to find us some great priced tickets for a show. Her husband does Uber part time, so that is an extra convenience for you. Thank You Lisa for all you did and those homemade cookies were delicious!!!"
334,3831,108110432,10/14/16,84162159,Lety,"Lisa's place is very nice and clean, the neighborhood is very quiet and the subway is really close.

335,3831,110674880,10/27/16,23265396,Daniela,"My friend and I spent almost 2 weeks at LisaRoxanne's place and really enjoyed it. The bedroom and the kitchen are pretty spacious compared to other apartments and the bed is extremely comfortable. I only met LisaRoxanne twice and she was very easy to communicate with and nice. When we had questions we messaged her and she always responded very quickly. She even provided us with beach towels because we did not expect it to be so warm in October. A week later she helped us out with umbrellas.All in all I would definitely stay at LisaRoxanne's again and recommend her to other New York travelers. We always felt safe and welcome."

It is located in one of my favorite neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Clinton Hill. You have access to a full-kitchen, great bathroom and very comfortable bed. I could not have asked for a better stay. One of my best Airbnb spaces to-date!"
341,3831,113950333,11/14/16,98835140,Ad,"We loved our stay at Lisa's, she was extreamely helpful, offered to drive my wife to her interview, helped move our car for street cleaning, saved us a parking spot. it was just more than a stay we felt like part of her extended family. Would definitely recommend Lisa's place if you are planning to stay around ny area. The place is very spacious, well lit, cozy and safe."

The neighbourhood is nice and there is an area of lots of shops and resteraunts in walking distance which towards the end of our trip we preferred to Manhattan. To go into the city is really easy by Train. "
347,3831,117267326,12/5/16,52315368,Vanessa,"Wir haben sieben Tage bei Lisa Roxanne & ihrer Familie gewohnt. Wir haben uns dort sehr wohl gefÃ_hlt. Die oberste Etage, mit KÃ_che, Bad & Schlafzimmer hat man komplett fÃ_r sich alleine & man kann kommen und gehen wie man mÃ¶chte. Man bekommt zwar gerÃ_uschmÃ_sig schon etwas von der Familie mit, allerdings hat uns in unserem Privatbereich nie jemand gestÃ¶rt. Zudem war bei unserer Ankunft alles sehr sauber. Zur Metro sind es nur wenige Gehminuten & von dort aus ist man in ca. 25 Minuten direkt in Manhattan. Wer also einen gÃ_nstigen Aufenthalt in New York verbringen mÃ¶chte & bereit ist auch ein bisschen zu fahren, fÃ_r den ist es die perfekte Unterkunft.:-)"

350,3831,121574204,12/17/16,52638036,Samira,"Wir haben 8 NÃ_chte in Lisas Unterkunft verbracht. Sie war immer sehr aufmerksam und zuvorkommend zu uns, hat mehrfach nachgefragt, ob alles in Ordnung ist und irgendetwas gebraucht wird. Zu Beginn erklÃ_rte sie uns die Umgebung und gab uns Tipps zum Einkaufen und fÃ_r Bars/CafÃ©s in Brooklyn. FuÃŸlÃ_ufig sind verschiedene U-Bahn-Stationen gut erreichbar, die nach Manhattan fÃ_hren.Da sich die Unterkunft in der obersten Etage des Einfamilienhauses befindet, hat man seinen eigenen Bereich mit Schlafzimmer, Bad und KÃ_che, bekommt aber das Leben der Familie akustisch mit. Man erreicht die oberste Etage Ã_ber das normale Treppenhaus, es gibt keine ""eigene"" TÃ_r, die den Bereich vom restlichen Wohnhaus trennt.Bad, KÃ_che und Schlafzimmer sind sehr sauber. HandtÃ_cher, FÃ¶n etc. stehen zur VerfÃ_gung, die KÃ_che ist gut ausgestattet.FÃ_r unsere Reise war die Unterkunft eine gute Wahl."
351,3831,121897195,12/19/16,23218875,Yann,Our stay in Brooklyn was comfortable and friendly. LisaRoxanne and her family warmly welcomed us and we had everything we needed including pancake mix and delicious coffee. We have a 3 year old son and he had his own twin bed with clean linens. She was flexible on the check in/check out times and reserved us a car to the airport. Great stay!
352,3831,125094225,1/3/17,30194708,Ioana,LisaRoxanne is a wonderful host and will go out of her way to make your stay memorable. The accomodation has all that you may need and the subway and shops are around 10 minutes away.
353,3831,125978170,1/8/17,26443839,Nicole,The stay was awesome.  Lisa was very generous with tips and information to make the most out of our stay. The place is bigger than the pictures made it seem.  It was very clean and smelled freshly scrubbed.  It's close to the subway and a nice neighborhood

355,3831,129451521,1/30/17,68168880,Agustina,"We stayed at Lisa home for almost three weeks and we had an amazing time. The kitchen and bathroom were brand new and fully equipped (she even left new toothbrushes for us!), the bedroom had three beds and we still were super comfortable. She received every package we sent, some of which arrived before us, with no complaints and changed our sheets and towels every week. There are kids in the house. We didn't care about the occasional noise but if it's something that bothers you, you maybe should take that into account. Overall we have absolutely no complaints! "

357,3831,130808624,2/8/17,131005,Monia,LisaRoxanne is a lovely person. However her listing description is not accurate. The set up is odd as it is actually inside their home. It is not a private apt/space and therefore should not be advertised as such. There is one key to the building's main entrance downstairs and that is it. The space does not have a front door you can lock when you leave for the day. You can hear the host family clearly as they are right down a few step (interior staircase). 
358,3831,131252030,2/11/17,44430509,Charlie,"Great place to stay on a budget! LisaRoxanne was friendly and accommodating. Plenty of beds and overnight materials for up to 5 guests, but know it's one bedroom and one kitchen/bathroom area on the top floor of their home, so it's not exactly the most private place to stay, but we were absolutely given our space and could easily come and go as we wished."
359,3831,132441463,2/17/17,29683319,Hannah,Our stay was absolutely perfect. We loved being in a fantastic area of Brooklyn. It was really easy to get into the city everyday. The apartment was spotless and we had our own little kitchen to make breakfast on a morning. LisaRoxanne was friendly and had helpfully printed us lots of useful travel instructions and local eateries. And it was easily the cheapest room available for miles! Thanks very much 
360,3831,133096594,2/20/17,393780,Marita,"Perfect spot for us this long weekend. We didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment, but when we were there it was just fine! The bed is comfortable and all the linens were clean. There are some thin curtains that work for privacy and do block some night street light, but not all. The apartment was clean and had all the amenities we needed. It was very quiet and we didn't see anyone except when we checked in. Private enough for us. We heard people occasionally - the family has some kids - but it was just normal living noises. The check-in was flexible. The location is good in terms of being accessible to Brooklyn and Manhatten. It was easy to get anywhere by car (or transit). We were able to get to Prospect Park very easily and it is close to transit lines, although we didn't use transit as we had our dog. The neighbourhood was pretty quiet and felt safe. Close to Clinton Hill. Great to be dog friendly for us! Would stay again. "

Of course we could here the family in the first floor but it was totally okay and not too loud. We definitly would come back if we are going to new york again :)"
363,3831,135566583,3/5/17,73698537,David,"This is a great place to stay in Brooklyn, with a very welcoming host and family who are very respectful of guests' privacy but also helpful and available as needed. Its terrific value accommodation and effectively comprises a one bedroom flat with a largish bedroom comfortably able to sleep 3 people, nice modenised bathroom and amply equipped kitchen. All this is located at the top of this family Brooklyn brownstone, which does mean using the same front door and staircase as the family but hey this is what airB'nB is all about isn't it? Once you're upstairs you are very much in your own space and self-containned, and the house is mercifully ( we went in late Feb/early March) very warm, and has constant hot water too.This served us very well as a base for exploring Brooklyn and Manhattan in particular as the brownstone is close to 4 subway stations the nearest two being around 6-8 mins walk and the other two, 10 and 15 mins respectively.Like most people we tended to go out after an early breakfast and spend the whole day and evening out coming back late to this rather quiet suburban area for a welcome relax and sleep.All in all: excellent value, great location, terrific hostess well equipped accommodationwith everything you're likely to need for a great holiday in NYC: we stayed for a week and loved every minute!"
364,3831,135983526,3/7/17,3691429,Kathy,"LisaRoxanne was a warm and inviting host.  The home is really best for a couple or singles who don't mind sharing a room.  The price was reasonable for what was offered, and it was an easy place from which to get around.Thanks LisaRoxanne!"
365,3831,136900481,3/12/17,65033665,Michael,Stayed here for 5 nights in early March with 2 friends. For 3 people who were out and about exploring as much as possible this was a perfect home base to rest up and get back out to the sight seeing.
366,3831,138996462,3/22/17,15930489,Stefanie,Lisa was great! Arranged local car service from and to JFK for us. Had some easy chats during our stay. The flat is nice and clean. The family has kids - but it was just normal living noises. The location is good and accessible to Brooklyn and Manhatten - it was easy to get anywhere by transit. Neighbourhood was quiet and felt safe. Some nice bars and restaurants in this area.
367,3831,141317518,4/2/17,42865886,Danielle,"LisaRoxanne was a wonderful host. She was super flexible with our check-in/out times and responsive to all our questions. The location is great--easy walk to several metro lines that get you all around town and into NYC in a reasonable amount of time. It was lovely to come back to this quiet neighborhood after a day of bustle in the city. There are several sweet markets, cafes, and restaurants within walking distance as well. It was nice to have the whole third floor with a full kitchen so you can cook if you like. This was especially handy for breakfast and coffee.  You can hear their sweet kids playing downstairs. It's not intrusive--they really respected our privacy-and it's just normal happy family noise. It was a wonderful stay all around!  Thank you LisaRoxanne!!"
368,3831,145980375,4/21/17,29683774,Rob,"Nice place to stay, away from hectic Manhattan. The house is old but the appartment itself is in een reasonable state. Bathroom and kitchen are well taken care of and functioning as they should. The beds are comfortabel and the tv is in working order. WiFi works proper. Going to Manhattan is really easy from several options. LisaRoxanne is totally prepared to help you with that. It takes a short subwaytrain to get there. When we come back to NYC in the future we would certainly choose for Brooklyn and wouldn't mind staying again at Gates 223! Thank you for hosting us,Rob en Erna"

373,3831,149908406,5/6/17,43350009,Danielle,The place was very clean and accurate.  Bed was comfy. I didn't fully utilize the kitchen but I really could with the amount of kitchen ware that was provided. Very clean neighborhood. Overall it was great.
374,3831,150718429,5/8/17,9989903,Kay,"Nice neighborhood , close to vegetarian vegan gluten free restaurant , near subway.However there are 30+ steps to climb to get to the third floor where you will be staying."
375,3831,152604314,5/17/17,3705526,Amanda,"Roxanne's top floor of her brownstone is a perfect way to stay in New York without the HUGE expense of Manhattan prices.  6 blocks from the subway was great.  The leafy street and surrounding area was lovely to walk through each day.  Restaurants and food markets close by to either eat at or buy supplies to eat in.  We would recommend anyone to stay there.  Great kitchen, bathroom is good and the bed extra comfy.  Being on the top floor we didn't hear a lot of passing traffic. Highly recommend this Airbnb.

Muy respetuosa de nuestro espacio, Agradable y siempre dispuesta a ayudar. El barrio es tranquilo y la casa esta ubicada a 5 cuadras del subte C que va a Manhattan y cuyas estaciones tocan casi todos los puntos turisticos. Recomiwndo este alojamiento."
378,3831,160512691,6/14/17,49424194,Alicia,LisaRoxanne's place is such a great location for staying in NYC! We were close to the subway and her street was relatively quiet compared to the high trafficked nearby areas. She was so helpful with our questions and was communicative regarding our inquiries! I would definitely recommend her place. 
379,3831,161578813,6/18/17,105962523,Jamie,We stayed with Lisa for 3.5 days in June for our anniversary. Upon arrival Lisa was very quick to get to the door and was in constant contact with us. The only thing that really was a concern for us was the smell of cats. My husband and I are both sensitive to cats and it finally caught up with us the last evening/morning of staying. The room was perfect for what we needed because we spent most of our time in the city. Only thing I wished the room had was a full length mirror so I could see my outfits better for our evenings. I would definitely recommend staying at Lisa's for any type of trip. She was a great host and evening got us a bottle of wine for our anniversary. Thanks Lisa
380,3831,164853880,6/29/17,60624405,Valerie,Lisa est vraiment adorable et trÃ¨s serviable. 
381,3831,166236446,7/3/17,82900308,Yvette,This was my first AirBNB experience and honestly I don't expect to find anywhere else that gives such attention to the comfort of guests. If you're limited on luggage space you could walk in here with nothing but clothes - LisaRoxanne has thought of everything from toothbrushes to UK adaptors! The space is great and transport into Manhattan easy.  You can have privacy if you want it but they are such a nice family I can't think why you wouldn't want to interact. Her little boy Isiah (sorry if I got that wrong) is a real darling.  Can't recommend highly enough. 
382,3831,168465269,7/9/17,38961133,Roger,"Low-key, quiet residential neighborhood with equally low-key but excellent nearby cafÃ©s and restaurants, and if you need stores, the DeKalb-Bedford Avenue business district is a 10-15-minute walk. Six to 10-minute walk to the nearest subway lines (G, S, A and C trains), and a 12-minute walk + subway ride or 25-minute walk to downtown Brooklyn. LisaRoxanne is friendly and attentive. We appreciated her detailed recommendations on where to go for coffee and food. The apartment was clean, with a modern kitchen and bathroom and comfortable bed. If we need a place in Brooklyn again, we'll definitely be back."

Le quartier est typique et agrÃ©able et Lisa Roxanne sympathique.Toutefois, j'aurais quelques remarques Ã  apporter: il faut savoir qu'il y a 3 enfants de moins de 10 ans dans la famille et que l'on entend tout ce qui se passe dans leur chambre dÃ¨s 6h30 du matin / le lit d'appoint pour la 3Ã¨me personne (moi en l'occurrence) est juste un cauchemar pour le dos, partez donc Ã  2 ;-) / difficile de faire la cuisine car les casseroles sont dans un Ã©tat lamentable (nous ne les avons pas utilisÃ©es du coup) / les sols Ã©taient sales et collants Ã  notre arrivÃ©e (je crois que les voyageurs s'enchaÃ®nent trop vite pour que l'hÃ´te ait le temps de faire le mÃ©nage...VoilÃ , ceci dit, nous avons Ã©videmment adorÃ© notre sÃ©jour, mais plus pour la proximitÃ© de NY que pour le confort du logement!"

Apartments located perfectly in Brooklyn, I prefer to walk instead of tacking a metro, so Brooklyn bridge and perfect views to Manhattan skyscrapers are just in 45 minutes of walk) also metro is very close, so there is no problem to get to the heart of NYC. Also LisaRoxanne gave nice recommendations where we can eat or spend evening."

Lisa and her family were very welcoming and accommodating to our family, even with a baby and a dog. Her house is close enough to a subway stop, that we were able to go in/out of Manhattan easily and see what we wanted to see. The cake she made for us to celebrate my husbandâ€™s birthday was above and beyond. The accommodations were clean, comfortable, and she provided all the modern amenities that a hotel would provide. It was more like a home away from home. My family and I enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend Lisa as a host."

The bedroom is spacious, the kitchen is fully equipped and the water is hot :) Lisa provided us with a comfy portable crib for our baby and we all slept well.Lisaâ€™s house is conveniently located to subways and Fulton St and lots of great eateries nearby.If youâ€™re traveling with heavy or much luggage, be prepared to carry it up two flights of stairs. No big deal. And plenty of space to store your things once youâ€™re up there.Would happily stay again! Thanks, Lisa."

Even when we did, eg. Towels or extra garbage bag, she was quick to respond.The apartment was also conveniently located between 2 subways of different lines.Lisa was also concerned about our arrival and often checked on us if we are okay. She also helped to coordinate our transfer to the airport for a reasonable price that we canâ€™t possibly get with Uber."

Die KÃ_che ist mit Gasherd, Backofen, Toaster, Mikrowelle und einer KÃ_hl-/Gefrierkombi gut ausgestattet. Die Betten waren bequem und der GerÃ_uschpegel Ã_berraschend gering. Die Fenster isolieren nicht viele GerÃ_usche, da die Wohnung aber in einem ruhigen und unserem Eindruck nach friedlichem Viertel liegt war das kein Problem. Das rund 7Mbit schnelle WLAN funktionierte Problemlos, LisaRoxanne war durchgehend gut zu erreichen und hat alle Fragen gerne beantwortet. Beim Check-In und Out sowie beim Verlassen und Betreten des Hauses zwischendurch gab es keine Probleme. Auch die Anbindung an die Subway ist gut, bis zur Clinton Washington Av, von der man ohne Umsteigen zu vielen SehenswÃ_rdigkeiten in Manhattan kommt, ist nur knapp 15 Minuten entfernt. An der Station gibt es auch einen gut sortierten Supermarkt. Wir kÃ¶nnen die Wohnung jedem Empfehlen, der kein fÃ_nf-Sterne Hotel sondern eine einfache aber gut ausgestattete Wohnung sucht."

Thanks to that we get to know really great people, everyone is so nice and Lisa and her family are lovely and very helpful. Plus you have and really great store in the corner so you can shop your groceries if you donâ€™t want to spend so much money in the city.

The place is perfectly located in a very cultural area of NYC between 2 Subway stations, and a cross town bus, so it was easy getting around NYC. There is also a great Bikram Yoga studio down the street for those yogiÂ´s visiting. For those concerned with neighborhood safety, I often came home late and felt safe. Her Apartment is a great size, a LARGE Studio for NY standards, and has everything one needs! Very comforting. Luna is also a great renter, if there was anything I needed she was quick to respond. I definitely recommend staying at LunaÂ´s for short or longer visits!"

The neighborhood can catch you off guard if you arrive at night. But its charm really grows after spending some time walking around. Logistically, Luna handled everything very well, even though my train arrived quite late. Overall, Luna's place is a pleasant reminder that Manhattan still has some spots that don't make you feel like your in a shopping mall.     "

The air conditioning in the bedroom was especially powerful and welcome in the hot summer heat!The only drawback for us was Tina's 2 friendly cats as I'm not really a cat lover and found it difficult to deal with. However, Tina was very clear in her advert that she has cats so that was entirely MY fault for not reading carefully!!An enjoyable trip!"
476,5099,8053,8/23/09,22880,Zoee,"We absolutely loved Tina's place. It is really close to everything and bigger than we expected it to be. Plus, her cats are amazing. We didn't want to leave we loved them so much. They are both super loving. It is an older building and apartment but that's kind of part of the NYC experience I guess. I was a bit unhappy that I didn't know it was a smoker's apartment until too late but once we got there and settled in, it didn't matter at all. We'd stay there again."
477,5099,10255,9/15/09,33505,Louise,"We enjoyed staying at Tina's apartment. The location was amazing, easy to keep tidy, and had everything we needed in there.Tina was there to greet us when we arrived, she was very friendly and explained everything we'd need to know very clearly, and was accessible the whole time we were there.There were only two small downsides, the first being the cats - although they were really lovely and friendly, we were faced with cleaning up poop and vomit one day, though that's nobody's fault. If you've never had cats before you might find this a bit daunting but we got on with it and it wasn't really a problem. The other downside was the outside noise, even with the windows closed it was quite noisy (with the traffic constantly moving outside), but we were so tired every night that we slept fine anyway.Thanks again Tina. :)"

487,5099,123951,10/21/10,245529,Patrick,"We recently stayed at Tina's apartment for a week.  The location is great as it is about a 10-minute walk from the Grand Central Station which with the subway can take you any where you want to go. The distance to the Airport Bus station that will take you with your luggage to the airport is also nearby. It is in a safe neighborhood.There is fast food and restaurant within a 2 block walk which is certainly convenient.  The place is what is in the picture.  It is clean when as promised.  Do note that there is a $50 cleanup fee to be paid upon arrival.  We thought the fee should be waived or be included inside the rental fee as it is the owner's obligation to hand over a clean apartment.Having to walk up the 5 floors has not been a problem even with 3 big luggages.  Having no wifi as advertised is also not a problem as we brought along our Apple Airport Express.You must love cats to stay in this apartment as they shed hair all week round.  It would be good to have a vacuum cleaner or a hair remover around. The poo smell of the cats was a little strong in the last couple of days of our stay.Tina was very friendly and had to leave the town for a few days.  She did leave an email to inquire if everything was alright.  That was thoughtful of her.  She also helped with maps of NY as well as advice about transport back to the airport for us which came in handy.Overall, a good place to stay in place of location and accessibility.  Thanks Tina, for your help."
488,5099,575470,9/27/11,1148802,Norma,"The apartment has an excellent location, you can go wherever in Manhattan by subway. The Central Station is within 5-10 minutes walking. The neighbourhood is good as well, you have some restaurantes nearby like subway, mcdonalds, sushi etc. There is also a mini market next door  where you can buy food and drink and the supermarket is 2 blocks away.Tina gave us a NYC guide and it was really useful, she left many brochures from restaurants also to order food at home.The cats aren't bad but they aren't clean at all, we found poop on the kitchen table once and we had to clean vomit like 4 times because one of them seemed to be sick. Because of this we didn't like to cook or even to eat at home and we didn't use the sofa because we found vomit there also.The windows have no blinds or dark curtains, so the neighbours can see you at any time in the bedroom and the kitchen.It is a 5th floor without elevator, it wasn't a problem for us but you should be aware of it.I do recommend Tina's place if you are looking for a well located place to sleep, but not to spend much time there."

Lot cooler than yr average NY hotel.This was my first airbnb experience, and I will definitely be doing it again, even though I'm not sure it was a whole lot cheaper than a grotty hotel.Only hassle was a mix-up over a cleaning fee after I left - why not just include it in the upfront cost?"

The apartment itself was clean and cosy, making me immediately feel at home. Tina send me several messages afterwards asking if there was anything I needed which I appreciated very much. The neighbourhood is at walking distance from big attractions like Time Square and the Empire State Building. Don't expect a quiet stay though because the Manhattan symphony of sirens, car horns and engine noise comes full blast through the windows 24/7. If you can stand that, there is no better place to be in New York. If you don't like walking stairs you might want a place that has an elevator."

She made some room for our stuff so we could have our stuff out comfortably and left us some nice toiletries to last our stay at her place. The air con machine and fan that she has in the apt were extremely welcome! Tina was a wonderful host and got out of her way numerous times to help us out. Our flight was delayed and she hang around to be able to welcome us properly, she took the time to know us and gave us great advice on the city, places to go, where to eat etc... She was always available on the phone and got back to us immediately every time. We could not be happier with her and the stay at her place. She became our New York Fairy Godmother! "

It's greatest asset is its location. It's right near Grand Central Station which means you can get virtually anywhere in New York - essential if you're travelling. It's also in a safe neighbourhood meaning you feel perfectly safe walking around after dark. However the noise from the street does carry up into the apartment, so if you're a light sleeper I'd recommend buying ear plugs.Tina is a great host. When we arrived, she ran through all of her favourite places to eat in the neighbourhood - she even knew awesome places that have gluten free options. She checked in with us daily and readily answered any questions we had about the places we were visiting.Would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting New York!"

My personal fav was a ramen place on 3rd avenue! Everything was clean and easy to use and the shower was hot and strong, which I hear is rare in manhattan. Just be warned that it's noisy in midtown so soak it up or take some earplugs! But that's all part of the manhattan experience! "

Her recommendations for food in all different areas of the city were spot on delicious. We did struggle with the five flights of stairs, no blinds on the windows and very aged mattress. But the neighborhood was very nice, safe and great food just right down stairs ""Bravest"". Subway was a few blocks away. Overall we had a great trip and would do it again in a heart beat."

She gave me some good recommendations with places where to go out. The neighborhood is very lively and there's many bars to go out nearby. The apt is located near grand central station, which is great for getting to and from the airport. There are many sights nearby to go out and see the city since it's in the heart of Manhattan. I would definitely stay there again if I return to NY."

522,5099,51452202,10/20/15,23211,Joanna,"Tina was very communicative and texted me a couple of weeks before we headed to NYC. She met us to check in and was helpful with nearby restaurants and recommendations. She texted almost every day to see how things were going. She sounds like she's been booking her place for a while and is very meticulous about things; her booking requirements, cancellation policy, and additional cleaning fee should be noted.We know we had to walk up stairs to get to her place on the 5th floor, but it was still exhausting every time! Loved AppleTV, you can definitely hear the traffic noise so light sleepers need earplugs. I noticed the shower head was really high so probably not ideal for petite/shorter people. Easy walk to Grand Central Station, Time Square, and Empire State Building, and small market on the corner is open 24/7.Overall great experience with Tina, her apt, the neighborhood, and loved NYC!"
523,5099,58782298,1/5/16,41256119,Francesco,"Il nostro soggiorno nell'appartamento di Tina Ã¨ stato piacevole.L'appartamento corrisponde alle foto. Ci aspettavamo che fosse un po' piÃ_ nuovo e curato (il letto aveva le molle molto rovinate e, sopratutto i primi giorni, si sentiva abbastanza puzza di fumo e un odore strano in casa). Ho amato particolarmente la zona soggiorno, con il bel divano, la poltrona in pelle e la Apple Tv per rilassarsi.Buona posizione (meno di dieci minuti a piedi dalla Grand Central Station); ottimo poi il wifi gratis. In appartamento facevamo solo colazione ma, volendo, la cucina Ã¨ abbastanza attrezzata per fare tranquillamente anche altri pasti.La comunicazione con Tina Ã¨ stata buona. A parte iniziali fraintendimenti, dopo esserci chiariti Tina Ã¨ stata molto gentile e disponibile e, durante il nostro soggiorno, ci scriveva spesso per sapere se andava tutto bene.Piccole annotazioni: le scale sono molte e ripide (Tina lo scrive chiaramente e quindi lo sapevamo!), portatevi valigie poco pesanti e comode da trasportare!!; il riscaldamento centralizzato funziona fin troppo bene (e non si puÃ_ spegnere), dovevamo dormire con le finestre del soggiorno leggermente aperte nonostante la stagione! Il traffico Ã¨ quello tipico di New York..Consiglio quindi dei tappi per le orecchie per il rumore e delle mascherine per gli occhi per dormire (le finestre non hanno gli oscuranti).Nel complesso siamo stati soddisfatti!! Vale la pena provare a vivere in un vero appartamento newyorkese e, sicuramente, si ha a disposizione molto piÃ_ spazio che in hotel.."

Her apartment is clean and good flow of air. Even if the aircon has to be removed due to impending hurricane, it was comfy enough. The location of the apartment is also great, little distance from the main tourist area but hey! what's NYC without the sirens from ambulance and FDNY! Try staying there and you feel like a real New Yorker! Oh! And her bed was super duper comfy!"

La localizaciÃ_n del apartamento es inmejorable, es espacioso y tal como se describe  en el anuncio. Tuvimos la mala suerte de que justo en la semana en que estuvimos la cocina estaba estropeada, asÃ_ que tuvimos que apaÃ±arnos solo con el microondas.

She was extremely accomodating as we arrived 2 hours before the check-in time that we had discussed and she came right over to check us in. She even helped us to carry our luggage upstairs.  She took the time to show us everything in the apartment that we may need and even offered us to use her personal things if we needed them. Donâ€™t let the 5 floor walk-up scare you, my wife and I travelled up and down these stairs many times per day. My wife handled the stairs like a champ and she is nearing 6 months pregnant. We were also able to walk to Times Square and to many of the activities that we did during the trip. As long as you donâ€™t mind a bit of a walk, the location is great. We enjoyed all of the exploring that we got to do along the way. There were also some great places to eat within a block or two.  Tina gave wonderful food and local recommendations that we tried and loved. We would definitely stay at Tinaâ€™s place again."

I am so happy that I had the opportunity to stay in such an interesting area.  The subway is close and there are a few little cafes nearby that I loved. You must go to Mrs Daliah's Cafe for cucumber lemonade! I got to meet another traveler staying there, who I hung out with, so that was cool. Also Garon's cats are so adorable.

The room was too small and a lot of stuffs inside (closet was full) for a 2 persons 6 days stay.In our opinion it's not really a rentable place, even if Garon's neighboor was very nice and helpfull, and even if Garon warned us about the possible untidyness in the place because of his absence."

Each of us had his own key and we were free to come and go as we wish - no hassle at all!A neighbourhood is nice. Manhattan is approx. 20min away - close to nothing! A lot of places to eat out -  I could recommend to anyone who plans to stay there to visit a food place right on the right of McDo, close to the A/C subway station - a great deal of specialities straight from Trynidad! =)"

It's pretty easy to get to subway G train or if you walk a little more you can get to A train which goes directly to JFK airport. Garon is a very kind person, very open-minded and friendly! We also have a lot in common in area of culture! I'll recommend this place to everyone who is open-minded and want to feel how people live there in NYC. Neighborhood looked safe.

The neighborhood is really interesting and beautiful, worth spending some time just wandering around.

The area is very safe, even at night, full of nice restaurants, pubs and cafe. There are two subway stations very close. If you are visiting NYC this is a good place where you can stay. "
579,5121,48208968,9/24/15,13718313,Zeynep,"Meeting Garon was the best part of my stay.I felt home from my first night at GAron s place.Thank you again,hope to meet soon!"
580,5121,48841122,9/28/15,30663960,Amanda,"Had a great stay at Garon's place. I left it right to the last minute to sort out accommodation and even though he wasn't actually around, he went out of his way to sort everything out for me. Really thankful!! Area is nice and has a few hidden gems. Would recommend :)"
581,5121,52023013,10/25/15,6154262,Martin,"Garon is a really nice guy, interesting to talk to and knows a lot about the area. He's one of the more personable hosts I've met. His cats are super friendly. I was worried about the futon but it honestly feels like a regular bed, I had a great nights sleep. I was happy to be in that part of brooklyn again, it's much more relaxed and the G train is really close. Would recommend."
582,5121,52776879,11/1/15,267281,Jer,"Garon was the nicest host I've ever dealt with on AirBnB, which is saying a lot because I've met some really nice hosts. I ended up having to adjust my pickup time for the key, which he graciously accommodated by having another wonderful person (Christian) meet me at the apartment. These are true gentlemen.The bed was very comfortable and cozy. I slept very well. Commutes to the Javits Center and other parts of Manhattan were a cinch, often as short as 30 minutes.This place is a really good value for someone needing a thrifty bed and a quiet place work or chill out. I hope to visit again."

591,5172,20178,12/13/09,52058,Nathalie,The apartment is very quiet and clean!  Very zen. And the bed is extremely comfortable.  We felt at home.  Parking nearby on 32nd btw 2nd and 3rd was very affordable.
592,5172,20542,12/16/09,55946,Jordan,Adrienne's apartment is very nice and clean.  It is in a convenient location just blocks down from the subway. We had a very comfortable experience in her apartment!

Adrienne is very easy to deal with and accommodating. Her apartment is a gem and I would stay here again without a doubt!"
597,5172,60798,7/4/10,136936,Samoa,Great little place in a lovely neighborhood. Adrinne was very friendly and easy to talk to. She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. We had a comfortable stay in her apartment.
598,5172,61812,7/6/10,122053,Ariel,"Adrienne, I have just seen your review and it surprises me how can you be so accurate when you were never there or never met you. What do you mean the apartment was not well kept? It is true I made the next guest wait, for approximately 40 minutes if I recall and I apologized to him, and it was time I spent cleaning for him. What do you mean the guest did not fit through the hallway? This has to be figurative speech because he did fit and left his stuff in the room while he went to buy groceries during that time. And again it wasn't late at night (6 or 7 P.M., the time the other guest was arriving doesn't constitute late at night, at least for the standards in my country). As it says below, you have to state the facts or at least get them right. I hope you got rid of the ant infection in the bathroom and kitchen, because it was very annoying. Apart from that everything was OK!"

600,5172,66462,7/19/10,123329,Cristina,"Adri was a wonderful host, she and her partners were very helpful and kind at all times. The flat is conveniently placed. Grand Central station really close and Empire State or Times Square at an easy 10-15 minutes walk more or less. Everything clean though bathroom a bit old. We missed a TV, nevertheless. Good value. Thanks Adrienne!"
601,5172,74912,8/7/10,105656,Bruce,"Adrienne was great at the initial contact, responded quickly when my other booking with AirBnB fell over. Really enjoyed staying in her apartment in Murray Hill. The place is small, but is a comfortable and quiet haven at the end of a busy NY day. The location is excellent too, and near some iconic NY landmarks. She is very generous, happy for guests to use her belongings. There is no TV, but hey, you don't go to New York City to watch television. Did not get to meet Adrienne directly, which was a pity, as she herself was away travelling. However, her friend Maria lives nearby, and was very helpful in Adrienne's absence. Thanks so much Adrienne, and best wishes to both of you!"
602,5172,78680,8/15/10,150252,Sophie,"A great host.  Everything came exactly as advertised.  Communicating with Adrienne and her friends was easy and reasonably quick.  Bruce M.'s comments below summarize our impressions well. There are some small outside costs, such as laundry pickup and dropoff, but worth the small effort as it keeps the overall cost down. Excellent value.  We would definitely stay again if the chance arises.Thanks Adrienne!"
603,5172,118318,10/13/10,221086,Elizabeth,"Adrienne's apartment was a wonderful place to stay!

The bed was indeed very comfortable which is a definite plus when you have exhausting days around Manhattan (yes, shopping). I didn't get to meet Adrienne personnally since she was away (which is logical if you are renting her place), but picking up the keys and giving them back went smoothly and her friend Maria was very nice and helpful.Would definitely try to book her place next time I come!"

615,5172,661858,10/25/11,559868,Tery,"To begin with, this was my first time using the Airbnb Service and my first time in NYC. Adrienne's placed looked very warm and cozy in her photos and was priced the most economical for my budget. Setting up this reservation was very easy. Adrienne replied to my email and accepted my reservation. She called before my arrival to NY to confirm and went over the procedure for our stay. She was very helpful with information on how to get to her apartment from the airport and where to pick up her keys. Her apartment was located in the most welcoming area (to my experience) in New York. Her Murray Hill apartment was close to the metro station, markets, restaurants and bars. What you see in her photos is exactly what you see in her apartment. It is a cozy and welcoming apartment that it you never want to leave. I truly enjoyed my first experience with Airbnb and in NY because I was able to experience it like a local. In the mornings I cooked breakfast, made lunch for my outings, enjoyed a cup of coffee (which was complimentary on her behave) in the evenings. Adrienne left us a package of helpful information with maps, books, things to do in NYC etc. My boyfriend and enjoyed our stay in her apartment and look forward to returning to Murray Hill soon. Thank you Adrienne! "
616,5172,957563,2/28/12,686930,Megan,We had an excellent stay at Adrienne's. She is very friendly and her place is great. Would definitely stay there again.
617,5172,993721,3/13/12,1854482,Jorge,"This place is centrally located, was able to walk most places that I needed to go. Very comfy bed (memory foam mattress). Great shower. Very clean. What else can you ask for?"
618,5172,1076344,4/2/12,1349760,Eddie,if you want someone bothering you about using too many towels then stay here .  
619,5172,1099288,4/8/12,2026796,Anthony,"Adrienne's apartment is right in the middle of NYC, great location with convenient subway stops at 33rd and Grand Central. When we arrived a friend of Adrienne's met us at the apartment and showed us how to use the keys. The apartment is exactly as you see in the photos, with perhaps a couple extra pieces of furniture added. The radiator seems to be automatically on, so it does get a bit warm. We were able to regulate the temperatuer by opening the windows and, if needed, turning on the AC. The bathroom was clean and a good size for the city, the only comment is the pole in the corner gets really hot and it nearly burned me once. The water for the matter also gets VERY VERY hot very quickly. Adrienne was very helpful while we were in NYC despite not being in town herself; she responded quickly to emails asking for help (i.e. we couldn't find the log-in information for the wifi). There was a nice welcome package on the kitchen table with little bits of information about the city. The kitchen was a good size as well (for the city) and we were able to use the fridge.  Overall it was a perfect place for our trip to NYC and we will DEFINITELY try to use Adrienne's place next time!!"

622,5172,7073479,9/5/13,461886,Mark,Adrienne's apt was perfect for my NY trip. Her place is conveniently located and the atmosphere of her home is cozy and relaxing. She communicated with me clearly and worked hard to get me the keys when there were last minute conflicts with our travel plans.

626,5172,12132906,4/23/14,13934057,Dhruv,"We stayed at Adrienneâ€™s apartment over the Easter weekend â€“ fabulous apartment, amazing location and all very convenient. Highly recommended. As other reviewers have pointed out earlier, the bed is very comfortable! Loads of good restaurants a short walk away and ideal for sightseeing in Manhattan. Much, much better than a hotel. While we did not meet Adrienne, she was very polite and quick to respond to emails - a very pleasant experience. "
627,5172,12760525,5/10/14,96001,Holly,"Quiet slice of Manhattan sums it up.   This apartment is quieter than most NY hotels.   I enjoyed the garden views out back and slept like a baby in that comfortable bed.  I loved Adrienne's sticky notes placed around the apartment to help navigate the new environment, super helpful.  Adrienne was a pleasure and always quick to respond via text or email.  A great value in the big apple.   "

We appreciated  the air conditioning in the bedroom,  the comfy bed, the breakfast makings and also Perk  Cafe's letting us hand in our keys before opening time so we could get to the  airport  in time for our flight. We will recommend  Adrienne's place to our friends."
630,5172,68590698,4/5/16,14600445,Tom,I didn't meet Adrienne but the apartment was just as described and a nice place to be for my short stay. The bedroom backs onto the yard so is quiet. There is a nice character to the place and the bedroom-kitcken-bathroom setup had all that I needed.
631,5172,69530461,4/11/16,10292753,Keren,"The apartment was just as described, wonderful location, very sweet place, though not much light. Adrianne was very kind and friendly on the phone. Make sure to ask Adrianne in the close-by key cafe' as in my case she wasn't sure I would get there on time, and left it at a 24h cafe' which was 22 blocks away. "

I would recommend staying here. "
633,5172,73714871,5/9/16,1640315,Raevv'n,"OH MY GOD LOCATION!!! Adrienne's place was an absolute delight. The size of it was cozy, and it had such a warm atmosphere to it. Me and my childhood best friend stayed at Adrienne's for a weekend in Manhattan and as two young women alone in a big city we never felt unsafe. The location was perfect. In New York you're going to be walking quite a lot, and Adrienne's place was just enough downtown that you felt like you were really getting the experience of the city that never sleeps but not too downtown that you didn't feel like it was your home to rest at, at the end of a long day. Only thing was we, personally, found that it was hot in the apartment at night, but having the window open while we slept fixed that right away! Adrienne's apartment had ANYTHING you might've forgotten to bring as well (we forgot to bring our blow dryer, and hair straightener). She really made us feel like we were staying at a home away from home. Adrienne was extremely kind, and responsive to all questions and enquiry's that we had. We will definitely be booking with Adrienne again when we decide to return back to this amazing city. Thanks for everything!! "

Very clean house, good contact with the owner,  smooth transfer with the keys. Good airco to cool the place. The owner left a map with information and a lot of things to do in New York. There only wasn't muts sunlight what made the apartment a bit dark. Also there was no space in a closet to put your stuff in. "

The size was more than comfortable for 2 people and it was clean as well as described and pictured accurately.  We spent a lot of time in other areas (Chelsea, West Village, East Village) as Murray Hill is very post graduate, young, etc but we could get to other areas with ease and come back to a safe, clean, affordable apartment in the middle of Manhattan!

I was able to get around the city super easily. The place is obviously her actual home and not a hotel style environment. Which makes the atmosphere feel warm and welcoming. It's away from the street so it was very quiet at night. There was instant hot water in the shower too. I did not get to meet Adrienne directly, but her instructions for the key exchange was super simple. Thank you so much for hosting me! I will definitely look you up again in the future!"

I would certainly stay here again if I come back to New York."
653,5172,256298175,4/22/18,184502444,Shannon,"Adrienne is a great host!  She was very helpful and responsive to your questions even though we never meet face to face.  Her place is cute, cozy, clean and is in an great neighborhood in NYC.  We thought the location was perfect with everything you need nearby - just the kind of NY experience we were looking for.  We hope to go back again someday and spend more time."
654,5172,260372929,5/4/18,99899361,Hilary,"Adrienneâ€™s place is really well located for those wanting to explore local attractions. It is walking distance to the UN, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Chrysler Building, and Grand Central Station. Very easy to get around, and a very comfortable place to stay. Also, convenient key pick-up and drop-off through use of key cafe. Highly recommend."
655,5172,261528241,5/6/18,41057133,Kristi,Adrienne was a great host. Super helpful and promptly answered any questions we had. The location itself is also very close to everything.
656,5172,265008307,5/15/18,52080183,Marie,Adrien is a very good host. The flat is Cosy and perfectly located to visit NY. I am recommending it.
657,5172,267713659,5/22/18,127523201,Robert,"Great location. Ground floor entrance.Lots of good places to eat nearby."
658,5172,270226976,5/28/18,160456354,Matthew,"Fantastic spot in Murray Hill. It truly is much bigger than it appears, comfy bed, and no complaints whatsoever. Would highly recommend "
659,5172,281283167,6/24/18,150154089,Cynthia,"Es justo lo que viene en la foto. Super buena atenciÃ_n limpio, cÃ©ntrico, solo. No microondas y no tv."
660,5172,284489159,7/1/18,3337144,Benno,"Adriennes place is very nice, and perfectly located to explore NYC. It was larger than expected, had a very comfy bed and all the amenities needed for a perfect stay. And the communication along the way was outstanding with very rapid responses to any questions. I highly recommend this place!"
661,5172,289998590,7/13/18,81989165,James,"Place was fantastic.Absolutely would recommend.Location fantastic but still quiet."
662,5172,295447663,7/23/18,63154981,Fan,Cool accommodation. Nicely furnished. Though a little bit far from subway station.ï_¢About ten minutes walkï_£
663,5172,297307956,7/27/18,51757932,Robin,"Adrienne's communication was fantastic and her place was so comfortable and convenient!  Everything was just as described and the location was perfect for getting anywhere (a short walk from Grand Central, and lots of restaurant choices, Trader Joe's, etc. right in the neighborhood).  The bed was superb (comfort of mattress, pillows, and linens) and the apartment itself was full of thoughtful touches and so peaceful - as it's on the back of the building all we heard in the evenings was birds going to sleep in the courtyard, and seeing green trees out the window was really refreshing.  Definitely the most peaceful nights I have ever had in NYC!  Key pickup and drop off from a lockbox was secure and convenient.  I can't recommend Adrienne highly enough as a hostess."
664,5172,305595596,8/11/18,159587772,Alex,"Adrienne is an immensely considerate, thoughtful and helpful host. She is extremely communicative and quick to reply if any issues arrive. She also goes above and beyond what is normally expected in ensuring that guests feel completely at home (even including a small box of emergency toiletries in case guests have forgotten any!). The apartment is very good value considering the excellent location and the space it provides. All in all, I recommend this apartment extremely highly!"
665,5172,309037098,8/17/18,436773,Sonya,"We enjoyed our stay in this centrally located apartment, which is very quiet and has an excellent bed.    It was very clean and had all the amenities we needed.  It is also an excellent value.  Adrienne was able to accomodate our last minute request to come a day early and was easy to communicate with.  FYI the key pick up is about 8-9 blocks away, so plan a little extra time for that when you arrive and depart.  The only negative  is that there is little natural light, at least in the summer, as it is a ground floor apartment.  However we were out and about during the day, so it was not a problem for us."
666,5172,315354484,8/28/18,149182042,Margaret,My boyfriend and I stayed here for a total of 9 days on a big NYC trip for the summer. The location of Adrienneâ€™s place is phenomenal. It is central to all major attractions and subway stations. It is also a safe area and very homey. Bed is very comfortable and considering this is New York it is actually great space for two-three people. The place is very clean and very well priced. Adrienne answers promptly and is a great resource for suggestions on anything to do in the city. There are restaurants and even a washeteria nearby if needed. The WiFi works very fast as well. I definitely plan on staying here again in the future. 
667,5172,318441718,9/3/18,21460379,Lauren,"Great space! Quiet, in the back of the building. Also a good location in the middle of the city for tourists.Adrienne was very responsive and helpful with checking in and out.There is a great smoothie/sandwich/salad/coffee place around the corner, on 1st Ave."
668,5172,319891885,9/7/18,154715775,Maggie,Quiet calm clean. We had a very nice stay
669,5172,323435768,9/15/18,186657451,Juan Antonio,Todo correcto. Buena ubicaciÃ_n y buena comunicaciÃ_n con el anfitriÃ_n
670,5178,2091,5/6/09,8443,Dimitri,"MR. Kasai was a grreat host , very helpful and hospitable , this room is really great value considering comfort and location , the only drawback is the street noise ;"
671,5178,3015,5/23/09,15642,Duong,The room is great and the hosts are superb!!
672,5178,4019,6/14/09,19644,Jim,"Very good experience. The room is clean, quiet (separated from the main living area) and centrally located in midtown Manhattan. I would recommend this room."
673,5178,5138,7/6/09,18347,Enki,"i agree with other reviewers in that the location is superb and the host is nice (total privacy is guaranteed), but i would not recommend this room if you're sensitive to noises (i felt as if i was sleeping in the center of the 8th avenue) and smell of smoking like myself. Especially, i barely slept due to the noises (construction, buses, fights of drunken men and women all night) ... i think that it might be because of the way air conditioner is attached to the window."
674,5178,8211,8/24/09,32936,Tomas,"Absolutely excellent. Couldnt have found a better room. Quiet, centrally located, clean and with more than enough personal space. Shun is a gracious host, and any person who chooses to stay here will not regret it!"
675,5178,8365,8/27/09,29676,Lukas,"nice and clean, good location"
676,5178,12867,10/9/09,31242,Michael,"Can't say enough positive things about this place and about Shunichi (Shun) and Akiko, especially for the VERY REASONABLE price.   Shun is a gracious and unobtrusive host.  He even offered to connect his extra laptop for me to have web access to look up theater times, museum info, etc.  The microwave, refrigerator, and flat panel TV (with cable) are all great amenities.  The street noise is really no big deal considering the very, very convenient 2nd floor location.  The noise is typical for New York.  Bring ear plugs and a sleeping pill if you really want to be assured a good night's sleep.  (Shun and Akiko, here is my one important suggestion:  Go to IKEA or Bed, Bath & Beyond (or even JCPenney) and get a set of matching sheets, duvet / comforter cover and 2-4 matching pillows and pillowcases.  The sheets,  and especially the pillows,  were sub-standard even at your very competitive rate.  If you do this, you would definitely earn 5-stars from me!  Thanks again for a fantastic stay overall!  You guys were wonderful!!"
677,5178,16180,11/4/09,23681,Eddie,"What a wonderful experience.  WOW!  The host, the apartment, the location, the price.  I could not have asked for a nicer, cleaner, more hospitable place and host.  If and when I return to NYC, I do hope this is still available.  If not, how sad for me.  Thank you for making my trip such a positive and enjoyable experience.  "
678,5178,19212,12/5/09,56221,Arthur,Had a nice quiet time at the apartment.  I got lots of privacy and the LOCATION was fabulous!  Can't beat it!
679,5178,19726,12/9/09,57415,Carole,"My three nights at the 55th Street room were perfect.  Shun met me as soon as I arrived on his doorstep. He showed me in and left me alone.  He seemed to understand from the moment I got there what I wanted and needed.  The room is clean and comfortable.  The down comforter and flat screen were more than I ever expected.  The tea and cocoa were perfect for the times I came in for a rest from my long walks on the sidewalks of my favorite city. The apartment is just three blocks from Columbus Circle,  and just a few blocks to the Theatre District.  There are good places to eat very near by. The bakery around the corner on Eighth Ave was very good and Luigiâ€™s Pizza across the avenue was a favorite of my teenage sonâ€™s last time we were there as a family.  I was able to live like a New Yorker for those three days and it was exactly what I needed.  I will definitely stay with Shun and Akiko again when I come to NYC. I recommend this accommodation to anyone who wants to experience living in NYC, not just visiting.  I know this neighborhood well, having lived there in the 80â€™s, and I could not have asked for more. It was like being home, only a lot better, because I was unfettered and able to do exactly what I wanted.  I canâ€™t wait to go back again. Thank you, Shun!  "
680,5178,23551,1/7/10,64742,Shahar,"the room is very nice and warm. the hosts are realy nice and friendly. the location of the place is great, close to all the places we wanted to visit in n.y and to the subway. highly recomended "
681,5178,24797,1/24/10,66519,Jeff,"My hosts were the best. Very clean, great location and made certain to meet me on arrival to insure I had what I needed and provided complete privacy, service and more than what I'd hoped to find. As a frequent business traveler for years it is now my preferred location and choice in NY. I will stay here again and highly recommend this to all of my contacts, friends and family."
682,5178,29344,3/14/10,35310,Serdar,"The apartment is not the place shown in the pictures, it was not clean, never met Akiko only her friend (Website hidden by Airbnb) unfortunetly I have nothing positive to say about my stay.  Sorry, but I feel cheated!! "
683,5178,33818,4/6/10,37224,Steffen,"It was very pleasant stay in New York. Shun is a great host and I would come back anytime. The Appartement is a nice one and equipped with everything you need (microwave, fast internet, cable tv etc.) Thank you Shun, it was a nice week in New York!"
684,5178,34688,4/10/10,103590,Tom,"I also had a great time in NYC and the apartment is well situated near the center (Times Square  / Central Park) and Columbus subway station.Shun and Akika were pleasant and although I came in late every night they hadn't an issue and even allowed me a late checkout.Apart from what Steffen F. mentioned you also have a working window Air Conditioner (AC) in the room - much needed for the upcoming summer.One comment is that the bed is a standard ""Double"" Width - 55"" / 1.4meter which is nice and large for a Single.Thanks Shun for a great ""In Manhattan"" option and allowing me in so late at night, I do hope to stay again ;)."
685,5178,35310,4/13/10,49565,Lance,I also had a great time in NYC and the apartment gave me what I wanted and needed.  Thank you Shun.
686,5178,37168,4/22/10,78096,Lourdes,"My friend and I had an amazing time in NYC thanks to the hospitality of Mr. Shun and Akiko. We were given more than ample privacy, the house rules were VERY reasonable. The room, bed, linens, and shared bathroom was clean. They were very kind and welcoming and we would recommend them to anyone who's looking for a great place, in a great location, at a very reasonable price."
687,5178,38906,4/30/10,100740,Juliana,"Great location in Manhattan, next to everything. Apartment a little bit old, and noisy, but it is Manhattan, so what do you expect? For the price I found it perfect!Shun is very nice, he also helped us with our baggage, he purt water for us in the fridge (there is a little fridge and microwave in the bedroom)We loved our stay in Shun apartment."
688,5178,50984,6/8/10,104290,Tara,"Really excellent location. Only a few blocks from Columbus Circle metro station and the 51st St station. Tons of great restaurants near by and even closer to the attractions than I expected. The room is very spacious and didn't feel like I was living out of a hotel room and it had a tea pot, microwave, and fridge.Provides towels and toiletries. I only saw Shun twice in 6 days so it was very private. Shun was very nice and I will stay here again on my next trip to NY. High recommend! "
689,5178,51656,6/10/10,105878,Anne,"Very kind and hospitable. Of course the location is great for everything.the room was spacious and included internet, and cooking possibilities.i would definitely return."
690,5178,54538,6/18/10,409,Mathieu,"Fantastic location, very private, I came and went as I pleased. Aircon was a blessing, and the internet fast as well. I would stay there again!"
691,5178,69674,7/27/10,106633,Flore,"We stayed at Shun's place for a week in july. His flat is EXTREMELY well located (5minutes walking from Times square and central park). It's also very close to the metro (didn't have to make any transfer in the subway during the week). Shun is nice, very discreet. Privacy garanteed. The bad point of being so well located is that it's very noisy, even during the night. The room was ok but not perfectly clean (dirty dishes, earings in the sheets, dust, ...). We do still recommand this place because of the price, and also of the location. "
692,5178,73918,8/5/10,122207,Barbara,"It is a perfect place to visit NY; all interesting places are near by, or you can use the subway. The room is ok, the bed is for one people very big :-)The only thing I did`nt like; the bathroom was dirty."
693,5178,80630,8/18/10,118953,Damien,"chambre tres bien situÃ©e, du bruit mais c'est normal on est en plein Manhatan. Le propriÃ©taire est tres discret je vous le recommande tres bonne adresse"
694,5178,83832,8/24/10,157885,Anil,"Host promptly and politely replied to all of our inquiries, and the room was simply furnished, but clean and comfortable.  The Midtown location is superb and we highly recommend this apartment.  Thanks Shun!"
695,5178,89441,9/3/10,144158,Javier,"This is a private room in a shared apartment with the host. Is very well located, close to subway station in a very safety neighbourhood, lots of dinners, restaurants, drugstores nearby. The host wakes up early to work, and as I went out and return late in the evening, it was like having a not shared apartment. Very clean and confortable. Bathroom in excellent conditions.Totally recommended."
696,5178,94059,9/10/10,98356,Amaury,"Oh my god ! Shun is an amazing host, very careful gives you all you need (towels, shampoo, internet adapter,...). The room is great and it has airco which is a real blessing in the deep heat summer of Manhattan! The location is amzing (a few blocks from Central Park, Time Square, MoMA and a lot of local amenties...) TI would recommend it to any couple that wanna visit NYC ! I'll definatly go back there !!"
697,5178,103749,9/24/10,121514,Ashanti,"I recently stayed at Shun's apartment (Sept 2010).The apartment is perfectly located in the heart of Manhattan. It is a close walking distance to times square, and major subways that makes commuting around NY very easy.I was in NY to take dance classes, and Shun's apartment was perfectly located within walkiing distance to Broadway Dance Centre (10-15mins), Steps on Broadway (20 mins) and Ailey Dance Centre (5-10 mins).  Shun was very hospitable allowing me to use his lap top and internet.  The room was spacious and entirely adequate as I only came back late at night to sleep for a few hours. The facilities were clean and adequate.Yes it can be a little noisy at nigh which made sleeping a little difficult, but the room, its location and the hosts were exactly what i needed for this trip.  I would thoroughly recommend this apartment to any single or couple looking to stay somewhere convenient in NY."
698,5178,113348,10/7/10,83244,Christophe,"I was in NYC from the 23rd Sept to the 06th Oct 2010. I had a great trip to NYC. The building is an old construction, one block away the famous and new Hearst Tower. Market open 24h one block away and more than 3 subway line 5 mins walking. The appartment is quite simple but with everything. Shun was a nice host, keeping your privacy and always helping. The appartment is 15 mins walking from 6th ave, Rockeffeler, Grand Army, Times Sq, 5 mins of Columbus Circle and Central Park ... Great ... In the heart of Midtown. Hope to come again soon."
699,5178,115787,10/11/10,116623,Maria,"Fantastic apartment, fantastic location and fantastic Shun. IÂ´ll go back. Un excelente trato y muy respetuoso con nuestra privacidad. Gracias Shun "
700,5178,122987,10/20/10,156379,Pablo,"It was my first experience in Airbnb and was perfect. Shun was very helpful and he was in his own world so the life in the apartment was like I had my own apartment.The apartment was clean, close to everything and I didnÂ´t miss anything. ItÂ´s a good option if you donÂ´t want luxury and you want a good place for a good price."
701,5178,127406,10/26/10,159969,Melissa+Ryan,"Shun was a gracious host, the room was as advertised and very clean was in a good part of manhattan which made our trip very enjoyable, would stay with shun again"
702,5178,136569,11/10/10,125337,Michelle,"Shun place is fantastic! Everything from clean towels, to toiletries was provided. Place is accessible to many prime location. No doubt it is noisy at times, but it is still a place which I would strongly recommend. - maybe it will be great to have a full length mirror in the room.- would also be great to have a small stool at the shoes area. Still, Shun is a helpful host whom doesn't have much restriction and respects the privacy of his guest. Thumbs up and highly recommended. Thank you Shun. "
703,5178,143980,11/24/10,225066,Elaine,Shun is very nice and quiet.  I had a great week of staying at his place. Big individual room with all facilities.  I love to come back again in future. The only thing to improve is the cigrate smell from his room.  It's separated from the rental room but the smell can travel to the whole place.  Shun should buy a airfilter to put in his room.  It will be a better environment. 
704,5178,144935,11/26/10,294291,Andrew,"Shun was a great host!! Spent a few days before thanksgiving.  Right in the middle of Midtown West.  Close to everything!! I didn't see Shun much, the room is very private.  Would rent from again next time in NYC!"
705,5178,153602,12/14/10,182487,Raquel,"Shun's appartment is in an excellent location. We had our privacy and the room was exactly as show on the photo. Very basic but clean. We probably only saw Shun 2 or 3 times during our stay. It was our first visit to New York and it would have been appreciated if Shun had at least on one occasion (perhaps upon arrival or the day after) offered some information about the area or check with us if we had any questions. We thought Shun was friendly but very reserved .Bottom line: great location, close to places of interest (we practically walked everywhere), clean but basic accommodation, however, don't expect a social, interactive host because once you've checked-in, you're on your own! Not an unpleasant experience overall."
706,5178,154880,12/17/10,172204,Bernard,"Great stay at Shun's apartment.  GREAT location, within walking distance of Times Square and a host of other attractions.  Spacious room, nicely warm despite frigid weather.  Lots of privacy, great internet connection.  Also lots of good inexpensive restaurants around.  I especially enjoyed a Cuban place around the corner with great Cuban jazz."
707,5178,155771,12/19/10,11327,Tippy,"This was our first time using airbnb and we couldn't be anymore thrilled we did. For the price and the location Shun's place was definitely worth it. We were within walking distance to everything, the subway was only 2 blocks north, along with columbus circle, central park and the time warner building. We only had to walk less than 8 mins to Radio City and rockefeller center. We had our own keys and could come and go as freely as we wanted. We had even came in really late a couple times. And we only saw Shun 2 times during the stay. We would definitely stay here again if we were to visit NY. Thanks!"
708,5178,157407,12/23/10,244211,Paola,"Shun is very kind and excellent host. The place is big and walking distance from Central Park and Times Square, we really enjoyed our time in NYC and we'll definitely recommend Shun's apartment. Thank you very much for everything!"
709,5178,164743,1/4/11,139152,Lianna & Adlan,"We would stay here again with Shun.  Perfect location for NYC, easy to get around on foot and subway (5min walk to closest subway).  24hr conveient store downstairs, bottle shop, pharmacy not far.  Shun was very quiet and kept to himself.  For what you pay, I couldn't ask for anything else.  Our plane was delayed because of the blizzard and didn't arrive till late at night.  He let us in and made us a coffee!  "
710,5178,167058,1/6/11,321907,Shin Gern,"I personally think that this apartment is a total worth of it's money. Yes, you could get an apartment which is halve it's price, but Shun keeps his place perfectly clean and provides many unexpected ammenities! Being a 3 street walk away from the Colombus Circle Subway, it's surrounding area's are brightly lit even after midnight.  "
711,5178,169667,1/12/11,125217,Danyah,"Shun's place is ideal for a short break to New York - just a 10 minute walk or less to times square and maybe 5 minutes to central park. Safe neighbourhood to walk around in at night. Room is fine, TV with a few channels and a desk there. bathroom is also fine. didnt really see that much of Shun as we were out exploring most of the time!! thanks for a plesant stay! if i come to NY again I would defo go bak there!he also seems to be very popular as others had just left as we got there and some more people were arriving as we left!!"
712,5178,170545,1/14/11,203342,James,Though I did not stay there I give Shun 5 stars! My flight was cancelled 2 days in a row due to a major snow storm and Shun was very nice about the whole thing. He could not have been more understanding with each call. I have him saved to my favorites for my next trip I will stay with him if its available. Thanks Shun!
713,5178,170955,1/16/11,294927,Azrina,"This was an excellent place to stay! Its close to all NYC's attractions and doorstep away from the high end of Fifth Ave and Central Park. It is also very convenient to the subway.  Room as big and clean, with all the necessities you need. Highly recommended."
714,5178,176140,1/30/11,93888,Charles,"Great location, flexible host, basic accommodation."
715,5178,178104,2/4/11,329867,Michael,"Great location. Its a real short walk to several neighborhood resturants on 9th! Basic room, but was perfect!"
716,5178,179393,2/7/11,211891,Mackline,"Shun's place was a great place to move around in the city.  It's about 15 mins by train to 34th street or Times square station.  There is couple of restaurants around the corner and pharmacy for all your immediate needs.  Shun was very flexible accomodating me as I was later than expected due to travel complications.  He waited at the apartment to receive me.  He even grabbed my bags up to the second floor. The main entrance is a small hallway that leads to the two rooms. If you a tad bit alergic to dust , you should not stay here.  Otherwise, the room is very large, with a small working fridge, microwave and lots of channels for cable.  This kitchen is a bit odd to use since it is in the host's living area and you would be separated by a glass door.  If you are there for a short stay then eating out and buying things that can be reheated would work best.  Although, Shun said that if I needed a cup or plate from the kitchen I was free to use which was nice of him.  The hosts were very quiet all weekend I really didn't see them.  Although, if I needed something I'm sure I could have asked.  I would say location-wise and room needs this was a decent place."
717,5178,188631,2/26/11,285023,Manon,"It was a perfect location. Near Central Park, Times Square, Subway station... Everything was perfect in the room and very well furnished. I highly recommend this place. This is an address I keep in my contacts for a future travel to NYC!"
718,5178,190162,2/28/11,55455,Omar,"Stayed here from feb 25th to 27th. Was my first visit to NYC. The pictures reflect what you get. The location is amazing as you are close to Time Square, Central park, 5th avenue, metro,etc... So for what you pay it's a great place to stay... But it's not a hotel... The inside of the building is not the greatest and in an OK condition. The Host was really quite, friendly and very helpful. You have a tv with a good selection of channels, wired interenet, a table, a chair and a stool. The bed is comfy.I enjoyed my stay there but I would probably stay in a hotel next time. If you are looking to save money then this is the place to be. If you an afford the extra 40 dollars/night then go for a hotel room."

Encore merci Ã  lui pour ce trÃ¨s bon sÃ©jour, nous recommandons cet hÃ©bergement, si nous devons retourner Ã  New York nous choisirons encore son appartement !"
720,5178,197093,3/12/11,269438,Keryn,"Previous reviews said it all so I knew what to expect when I arrived. Shun was very accommodating from initial contact to meeting up, making the whole experience hassle free. Perfect location to get around to all the sights and around restaurants/eateries not in the high tourist area. Had a great meal/marguerita at Cancun, just around the corner. The room is as described, handy to have your own fridge/kettle in the room, and great to spread out on the table/chair/shelves/wardrobe so you're not living out of your bag the whole time. Would recommend to others looking for budget accommodation without sacrificing too much."
721,5178,198656,3/14/11,274106,Jai,"The location is amazing and Shun is a very wonderful host.  The building itself is rather old, like most buildings are in NYC, but you can't beat the price for the location and wonderful host! Thanks Shun!"

723,5178,216385,4/4/11,264875,Laura,"Great Location, with different subway lines just a couple of blocks walking north or east. Shun was a very quiet host, but that doesn't diminish the great location and accessible price of the place. He  helped me a lot lending me an Apple Express to have wireless wifi while staying there. Really safe neighborhood and got everything near (places to eat, buy food, drug store, shoe repair, Fedex, etc) just by walking. This is a perfect choice for people who want to save money and be in a quite central place. "

We didn't see Shun very often, only when we arrived. We liked it that way so it was perfect for us. If you want to stay in a clean, central place, with privacy then this is the place to stay."

There is an air conditioner in the room, which is very useful in summer.The bathroom and the room are quite clean but the apartment and the inside of the building should be refurbished.Also, as the apartment is very close to 8th Ave., they is some traffic noise. I only saw Shun once when I arrived. He was very quiet and respected my privacy. For the price, i really think it's a great deal.Thanks Shun !"

Close to the subway and in walking distance of many points of interests.Though, the room is not so clean and cosy as it looks like on the pictures. The host was friendly to let us in, but we didin't see him the rest of our stay (4 nights). If you want to be left alone during your stay, this is a good alternative. "

We were also glad to have privacy. There were a few evening we got to say hello and peak our head into his living room to greet his cat. Otherwise, we mostly communicated when we arrived and departed. The apartment was clean, especially our room! On top of the cleanliness, his place is in a great location. It could not have been better. There were little grocery stores, places to eat, wonderful galleries, and central park all located in a close vicinity to his place! We definitely recommend staying with Shun! "
744,5178,624967,10/13/11,637612,JesÃºs,"Situacion estupenda, el anfitrion fue amable aunque solo lo vimos el dia de llegada y el de salida. Por otro lado tanto la limpieza, mobiliario e intalaciones de la casa tercermundistas totalmente. El baÃ±o y la habitacion estaba super sucio y durante los 12 dias de estancia ni tan siquiera se nos ofrecio un cambio de toallas o sabanas.La valoracion entre precio y servicio es como para otro viaje plantearse no utilizar esta pagina"
745,5178,630702,10/16/11,981049,Charlotte,"This place was really central, just 5-1minute walk to time square which was great. The place was less clean then expected, but the room was reasonably spacious with it's own fridge, cutlery & table. Shun was quite a private guy, we didn't see him much. Overall reasonable for the price, thanks Shun."
746,5178,644485,10/19/11,521606,Lyn,"Shun is so kind, the room is big (he kindly put an extra mattress for a third person) and is really comfortable. The bathroom was always clean and available and he offers everything you can need. The location is the best, you are close to everything, just two blocks of the nearest subway and in the area are plenty of delis so you can eat cheap and on the go. Only one thing, try to visit NY without many lugage, because travelling on the subway, streets or taking luggage trough the stairs, is not so nice if you have big pieces. I definitely recommend Shun if you are lucky enough to find availability in his appartment."
747,5178,686637,11/2/11,1200517,Renee,"I can't really complain.  It was great considering the price and area.  The area was very convenient and perfect for me.    Shun was rarely ever home, but very nice.  He let me store my luggage for about 4 hours after check out because I didn't want to lug it around.  I would stay here again for sure."
748,5178,697252,11/7/11,744809,Jana,"Having booked the first time with airbnb we were happy that our host and room was as described earlier. Shun is a friendly guy who still was preparing our room when we arrived an hour  early as announced. The room was large enough for two, has fridge and sat TV. Shun provided WIfi and wired internet access. The clean room itself is located near a subway which makes going with metro very easy. We have been a lot around in manhattan and enjoyed our stay for sleep and a shower at Shun. Near to this room we suggest a visit at Carnegie Deli for breakfast. Thanx Shun for beeing our host."
749,5178,740991,11/24/11,721906,Bernedett,"We we're about 2 hours late because of traffic and when we arrive Shun was very helpfull, he help with carring up our bags, he helped up with the closest subway. The room is spacious enough for 2 people, we enjoyed our stay alot!! We definaitly recommend this apartment to anyone that wants to stay at a good price, and be close to everything."
750,5178,781890,12/13/11,870987,Caitlin,"Fantastic location! Shun was very accommodating with arrival times and showed us around the apartment when we arrived. Room is quite large, well heated, and has great amenities (fridge, microwave, kettle). Most of the time we did not even see the hosts, as they kept to themselves or were at work. Only problem we had was getting the shower to stay at a decent temperature as it tended to be too hot or cold. Otherwise was a great experience, would definitely recommend!  "
751,5178,798934,12/21/11,882170,Eric,"Great location, walking distance to Columbus Circle, Central Park and Times Square. Subway is just one block away. If you're a tourist and doing things til late night, you can easily go back to the room. There's also plenty of 24hr food in the neighborhood. The internet is fast & reliable.The plumbing is old, so getting the water to stay at the temperature you want can be a bit tricky. But it's a minor issue. "

It is very simple, but has everything one need to a good staying. Shunichi is concerned in providing a good accomodation and was available when requested. "
753,5178,852090,1/9/12,1456486,Vivian,"My sister and I stayed in Shun's apt for 4 nights.  The room is indeed located in a prime location - super convenient for any tourist needs and close to Times Square.  Also located very close to a metro stop so getting around is very simple.  The room itself was nice and plain.  It is also adequately warm.  There was a microwave, fridge, closet space, desk and even an extra heater.  The bed and pillows were a little hard -- but spacious.  The traffic outside can get a little loud.  Like previous reviews, the hot water in the shower is a bit tricky, but I didn't have too much trouble figuring out how to get it to work.Shun is pretty private but is always ready to assist and help accomodate any needs/requests.  We were usually gone all day so there was minimal interaction with the host.  The overal experience was very positive and if I ever need lodgings in Manhattan again, I would definitely see if Shun's place is up for grabs.  The only real criticism I have is that I didn't find the bed/pillows very comfortable (My sister said she liked firmer beds, so it's just a preference).  "
754,5178,872866,1/20/12,1430948,Dale,"Because I was in NYC in January specifically to see a number of shows (8!) and visit MOMA, the Guggenheim and the new World Trade Center memorial, staying at Shunichi's was perfect for me.  The room was warm and comfortable.  The small refrigerator and microwave were extremely helpful in keeping expenses down.  (Shun offers access to his kitchen off the main living room but I never used it, except to wash a few dishes.)  There is a TV, and the bed is large and cozy.  The bathroom is nice, and the shower is very good.  One irony is that, after an initial meeting with Shun during which he gave me a friendly orientation to the room and the apartment, I only caught brief glimpses of him for the next 9 days.  He was off to work by 8:00 a.m. and came home usually late so I had almost no contact with him!  For someone like me, seeking a warm abode while spending most days and many evenings out and about in Manhattan and Brooklyn, it was an extremely economical way to visit NYC and stay in a very central location (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
755,5178,878719,1/23/12,1582319,Micah,Clean room.  Flawless location.  Cordial host.  The right price.  The room is old and spare but well priced and quite comfortable.  I recommend it.

If you are a busy traveler, who will be most likely spending time outside (especially downtown Manhattan) and wants to have privacy and spend quite time for good rest at the end of the day at the place you stay, his place will be the perfect choice for you. The stuffs I listed under [What I did not like] should be considered as minor issues. My overall experience was very positive. [What I liked](1) Location was truly AMAZING. You cannot ask for more. Very close to Columbus Circle subway station and there were many little places to grab something to eat. There are 24 hours McDonald, Starbucks, 24 hours grocery store, Central Park, Shopping Mall and so on very close by. (2) Shun was a wonderful host. He is very flexible, kind, and communicative. He adjusted check-in, check-out time for me and even took care of my luggage on the day I was supposed to check out because I had to wait until 6PM to get in to the next accommodation arrangement. (3) Wireless Internet works very well, and TV in the room has many channels you can enjoy while you are in your room, (4) Fridge, microwave, some plates, and flatware in the room come extremely handy when you want to keep some drinks cold and have little snack without having to use the kitchen[What I did not like](1) It was very tricky to use shower temperature control. The water becomes easily too cold or hot. (2) Lighting in the room was bit dark to me (3) No mirror in the room (4) Heating system was broken at the time I stayed, so I had to use Shun's small portable heater that was not strong enough"

I wanted somewhere that was in a decent area, not pricy and within a good distance of all the Manhattan attractions.  A friend on (Hidden by Airbnb) told me about this site because the prices for hotels were ridiculous.  I came across this posting and it was great.  Right off of 8th Ave, less than 5 blocks to beautiful Central Park and not far from Times Square and Penn Station.  If walking doesn't bother you and you want to fit in like a New Yorker, you can definitely get around to all the attractions without having to pay for a taxi or taking the subways.  My girlfriend and I had a great time!  The room is not luxurious, but if you want a secure place to rest your head at night and still be in the main area of Times Square, it is perfect. There is a fridge, microwave, TV and DVD player in the room, and also free wi-fi for those who need to access the internet.  I have no complaints other than it being a little hot in the room because the weather was nice when we were there.  Other than not having a fan in the room, everything else was great."

775,5178,1260860,5/11/12,1596174,Phil,"I arrived right around the time that I arranged with Shun to be there. Shun came down to the door and let me in. Perhaps he did this in order to lead me directly to the apartment the first time, as I might conceivably have gotten confused as to where the apartment is, due to the stairway and apartment layout. Anyway, first appearances of the building might be scary for some. It is rather run down. Indeed, the apartment must not have enough storage space because there are boxes lining the hallway leading to the main part of the apartment. The room is very basic, but is as advertised. There is a small refrigerator, some dishes and a microwave, a TV and WiFi. The apartment could use a cosmetic facelift, for sure, but apart from that, it was comfortable enough, though spartan. After introductions, I didn't see Shun again until shortly before I left. All in all, though I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for everyone, I would definitely return due to the convenience of location. Shun is pleasant, very quiet and reliable."

If you are a good walker, you can do a lot of things even without taking a taxi or the subway. Otherwise, a lot of subway stations are nearby. The apartment is none too cozy, but it is big and very private and you have everything in it you need (Wifi, dishes, fridge etc) and by the way, you will hardly find an accommodation in this area which offers you all this and still is affordable.

790,5178,2569600,10/10/12,1764846,Bram,"We had a great time in New York City and our stay at Large Furnished certainly contributed to that! We received keys off the building, appartment and room and could use the bathroom and even the kitchen when Shun was not in. For two persons the place was big enough and the location at the intersection off 55th street and 8th avenue was on a walking distance of times square and the subway station at 50th street... Very nice!"
791,5178,2627406,10/16/12,1486293,Ann,"This is the best deal in NYC!!!   The location is perfect and the room adequate and comfortable.  There is a microwave, fridge, and kettle with a variety of teas and coffee in the room so it is very self contained.  If you need additional kitchen facilities they are available when Shun is at work.  He is very quiet and I only saw him on arrival.  Shun was clear in the directions and everything worked out perfectly.  He was extremely helpful and set up a lap top computer for my use.  That was very kind and I greatly appreciated it. THANK YOU."
792,5178,2677389,10/22/12,1784456,Mareike,Everything was like discript. The room is very central and good to recieve by public transport. Shun answerd always very fast and was very friendly. Would go there everytime again.
793,5178,2847823,11/10/12,2973497,Celia,"LOCATION LOCATION AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE!If you want a place to stay in the heart of midtown and where your privacy is well-respected, then this is the place to be!Shun is a prompt communicator. He greeted me at the door and carried my heavy bag to my room. I didn't see him in the week I was there -  great to feel I had my own space and no curfew. However, any advice I needed, Shun was always willing to help.The room itself is spacious, has a microwave, a mini fridge, eating utensils, a tv and loads of pamphlets and general info on NYC. The mattress is a little hard and unless you don't mind snuggling in with another person with close contact, then it's ideal for one person only. Sure the street is loud (being on W55th and 8th) and the window's are not double-glazed so I'd recommend buying earplugs if noise is an issue.The only discomfort at times was the hot water taking a long time to heat up for showers - again, it's expected for an older building with old plumbing. The bathroom is shared and relatively clean.You're given your own key to come and go when please. Everything is right at your front door from restaurants to pharmacies. Times Square not far nor is Central Park (a must see) and the subway. Just a head's up there's no washing machine. You'll find the laundromat on 9th ave, a block away. I highly recommend Shun!! Many thanks :-)"
794,5178,2883420,11/14/12,1458876,Michael,"Shun's unit is a simply-furnished room with a bed, bedding, functional shelving and seating, a microwave and small refrigerator.  A large window looks out to W 55th Street from the second floor.  The picture in the listing represents it well.Stairs lead to the second-floor unit; Shun helped with my luggage, and was kind and communicative.  (There is no elevator.)  First entry is by door buzzer; after that one has keys.  There is street noise at all times of day and night; one gets accustomed to this and to audible chaos in New York.  There is some noise abatement from closing the window and curtain.In October, it was chilly:  a nice touch is the ceramic heater.  Cooling is accomplished by raising the window slightly.  The (shared) bathroom is just outside the unit door, and also has a permanent-on heater.  The hosts ask guests to avoid using the bathroom 7-8mam weekdays, but this can be negotiated.  I saw the hosts only briefly on arrival.  The unit is ideally located:  near the theatre district, and four blocks south of Columbus Circle, near Lincoln Center.  There's a lovely 24-hour cale/deli around the corner on 8th avenue (Bread Box), and a sizable (and busy) Starbucks on 57th two blocks north.I slept reasonably, given the noise outside.  If this, or bedding (hard/soft) or other details are important, these are things to discuss with any host.  I'm just learning about the features important to me.I recommend Shun's unit to anyone who needs simple lodging in the theatre district."

The location is very close to columbus circle and other convenient subway stops, central park, etc, so it was really easy to get around. the room is spare, but warm and has plenty of shelving etc. he provided cups and bowls, a microwave and mini fridge, so i felt i could be somewhat selfsufficient - i did use his kitchen once. The sheets and room were clean, and the bathroom was very clean as well. i didn't turn on the tv, but it was there staring at me. i would have liked to have more hangers in the closet and access to an iron if possible, but it wasn't a big deal.Shun's airbnb room needs art. airbnb community - lets give shun some art! other than staring at the spare walls, i had a great stay."

Shun was however very friendly and we communicated when needed by sms - always very promptly. Check-in was a breeze. The neighborhood was excellent, safe with heaps of eating places within a five minute walk radius. Based from Shun's room we walked lots of NYC. The room is secure and basic but comfortable for all who spend their time out on the streets and in New York that's where you wanna be eh? Thanks Shun, we'll be back sometime!"

816,5178,5375277,6/27/13,4542935,Nadja,"First of all we have to say that the hosts (Shun & Akiko) are really friendly, quiet and helpful. For staying connected Shun borrowed us his Blackberry because the airline lost our complete baggage. Thanks for that!Unfortunately we have nothing good to say about our room. It's true that the room needs a fresh painting as stated before. The pictures in this ad must be taken years ago or are simply photoshopped because the walls are more black of dirt as white as they seem on the pictures. The whole room was unbelievable dirty and seemed not beeing cleaned properly for ages. Hairs everywhere, crumbs on the floor and a lot of dust. Honestly it was a small shock when we entered the room for the first time. Before our trip to New York we read all of the ratings here and decided us for Shun, because nearly everyone stated how clean the apartement is. We are definitely not stuffy, but this is simply not true.  The same for the bathroom. Dozens of hairs everywhere (floor,  washbasin, shower) and a lot of mold on the shower curtain, the window and the  bath tub. Honestly it was a kind of disgusting.This was our first trip with airbnb and it was probably our last too. We have no explanation how 140+ ratings can differ from our impression so much. Nevertheless we had a great time in NYC and had to arrange with the whole situation at ""home"".June 2013"
817,5178,5504545,7/3/13,1458876,Michael,"This was my second stay with Shun.  He's an excellent and prompt communicator.  The lodging is exactly as described, furnished with a terrific A/C, mini-refrigerator and microwave. Queen bed is comfy. Situation is perfect for a theater-goer, by walking or easy cab ride. I'm slightly mobility-disabled and Shun's unit is just one flight up. He helped me with luggage on arrival. Perfect wireless. Several reasonable eating options very close:  Bread Box on 8th and Hale/Hearty (soup,salad,sandwich) across street. Thank you, Shun!"
818,5178,5688823,7/12/13,4803765,Ken,"Location, location, location!  Shunichi's place has the perfect location in New York - you walk out the door to restaurants, laundreys, whatever you want - and can then walk to Central Park or the Broadway theater district with ease.  At first I thought his building was a little run-down, but the room itself had everything I needed - a small fridge, air-conditioning (it was hot!), a microwave, dishes, cutlery, a desk, storage space, and a comfortable bed.  The shower would be better with more water pressure, but this was a minor matter.  Shun himself was there waiting for me and helped with the luggage.  He's a fairly quiet, retiring sort and I didn't see him much during my stay - which made me feel like it was my own place.  A great stay - thanks, Shun!"

825,5178,8470698,11/1/13,9486553,Subhash,"For starters, great location. I was in NYC for only 3 days and 2 nights which meant i had to do a lot of running around and the location certainly helped. The apartment is located a couple of blocks south of central park and the subway station and a few blocks north of times square which made for great travelling times to all parts of the city. The apartment itself was nothing special. All the amenities were as described in the website except for an air conditioner, which i obviously did not need as i was visiting in winter. The room looked a bit worn down and probably needed a paint job. Some people here commented that the toilet was dirty but that was not the case. The apartment and toilet was a bit worn down but by no means dirty. Keep in mind that you are renting an apartment and not a luxury hotel. It is certainly good value for money and a great place to stay for a couple of days. Last but not the least, the host was very polite and friendly and i didn't get to see him much except while checking in and checking out. So, my honest assessment and recommendation is this- If you are looking for luxury and great comfort, then go to a luxury hotel. But if you want value for money, great location and a new yorker feeling stay at shunichi's, you'll not regret it!!"

Short walk to subway, central park, times sq, plenty of places to eat, etc etc etc. Just perfect really. Anyone who hasn't been to Manhattan the place is easy to get around to all tourist attractions via the subway. $31 for a 7-day MetroCard with unlimited train & bus use.  Shunichi met me at check in & showed my the unit & all important things. We didn't see each other much at all for my whole 8-day stay. I will book with Shunichi again / every visit to NYC.

830,5178,9078190,12/5/13,4892465,Ben,The photo gives a better image of the room than what it is. The room is small and can be cramped.  It is a good incentive to be out sightseeing all day and only using it for sleeping in. The bed was uncomfortable though.  But you cannot beat the location! The room is located four doors from the Soup Man and a 10 min walk to Times Square and 5 min walk to Central Park. Meals are best had outside the room at any of the many nearby diners and restaurants. Great breakfast at Cosmic Diner.  The shared bathroom was not a problem and the water was hot. Consider this if you want location and are prepared to put up with basics.

I was not there more than 6 hours each day and never saw him after he let me in.  It was worth the cost savings.  Just be aware this IS NOT A HOTEL   Bring a towel.  I had to buy one.

Chambre grande, dommage qu'elle soit spartiate car c'est un beau volume. Mais Ã§a suffit pour un sÃ©jour Ã  New York.Sinon les points positifs qu'il faut reconnaÃ®tre, un hÃ´te trÃ¨s accommodant, flexible et qui nous garde les bagages jusqu'au dÃ©part.

844,5178,12421258,5/2/14,8558877,Pauline,"Bonjour, nous avons sÃ©journÃ© 8 jours chez Sunichi Kasai dans la chambre meublÃ©e. A notre arrivÃ©e, nous avons croisÃ© un couple qui venait de sÃ©journer 2 nuits et qui nous a prÃ©venu que la chambre (et l'appartement) n'Ã©taient pas trÃ¨s propres. et nous pouvons le confirmer: la peinture de la chambre est Ã©caillÃ©e et pas nette  le micro-onde et le frigo n'avaient pas Ã©tÃ© nettoyÃ©s, il y avait une tache sur la plaque tournante du micro-onde, nous ne l'avons donc pas utilisÃ©..., la salle de bains n'Ã©tait pas nette non plus et les joints de la baignoire Ã©taient moisis, le plafond et les murs abimÃ©s. les 2 photos sur votre site ne correspondent donc plus Ã  l'Ã©tat actuel de la chambre, je pense que le mÃ©nage n'avait pas Ã©tÃ© fait Ã  notre (Website hidden by Airbnb) a Ã©tÃ© fait trÃ¨s rapidement et pas Ã  fond le 1er jour . il y a donc une dÃ©tÃ©rioration depuis quelques mois voire deux annÃ©es..les points positifs sont la situation idÃ©ale prÃ¨s de central park et de broadway, et la discrÃ©tion et le calme de l'hote qui rentrait tard du travail; nous pouvions utiliser la salle de bains autant que nous voulions."
845,5178,12649702,5/7/14,9736455,Maria,"My first experience with Airbnb in this apartment in Manhattan turned out to be a nightmare. As the host had told us, he or she (we never got to know their gender) would not be at the apt when we arrived. Instead, we were given the keys and some info on the location of the room and the shared bathroom, by a friend of the host. Although the apt was not as shown in the pictures, but a little dirtier and with the walls really bad painted, we did not care. The building is very old and the rugs look disgusting, but we did not care either.... until we spent the first 2 nights and we realised we were not alone. The room was heavily infested with bed bugs.  Out of the 4 nights payed, we could not sleep for 2 whole nights, I had to get medications for rashes that developed from the bites and I had our clothes and baggage sterilized because these bugs travel with you once you get them.Other issues with the apartment:The headless photo mounted on the page for the apartment also prevented any easy identification of the person owning or managing it.The photos advertising the apartment did not correspond to the apartment.I would strongly advise you not to rent this apartment, specially if you suffer from any allergies or if you wish to sleep. The worst part of the story, the bugs feed on blood and we had killed one and the stain stayed in the wall. When we came back from one of our tours, the stain was not there any more, which may mean that the host cleaned it and, hence, that he or she knew that the room was full of bed bugs.I spent a lot of money on medications and lotions to get the rashes out of my whole body (even my face). Be safe, don't go there. Pictures of the bites available upon request!"

I felt it wasn't adequate given it was about -10C outside. It was cold and I had to bundle up just to sleep and also wear 2 layers of socks to walk around the room (thumbs down). It would have been nice to know this ahead of time so I had the option to consider other places.- As there was just one bathroom, there was a note on the door about bathroom usage and when would be blackout periods - this also would have been nice to know in advance (thumbs down).- I didn't really stay long enough to interact with the owner of the place but I did make an effort to at least say hello.- Overall the place looks a bit run down and obviously needs work."

The location was perfect right in the theatre district.His girlfriend let me into the apartment and basically just let me know which key was which. However the rules of the house were clearly printed on the inside of the door so I had no further questions. I only spoke to Shunichi once to let him know at what time I was checking out. For the rest, I didn't see or hear them.The apartment is basic and somewhat run down. Although clean, tidy and reasonably equipped. It's a bit too prosaic for a romantic get-away :)The central location makes up for this.My only real problem was with the plastic cover over the mattress. There was a fitted sheet over this but still... not very pleasant. Although the bed itself was fine."

There's no elevators so make sure your bags aren't to hefty to carry up.  As a former New York resident, the room looked like the average apartment, although I have to admit that the pictures made the room looked cleaner and new.  I love that they were towels on the shelves, hair spray, and a microwave included.  Our stay was brief (8:30pm to 4am) as we were on a flight layover. We left our luggages and mostly roamed the city the majority of the night.  There's a small couch. The location was perfect as it is in midtown steps away from Columbus Circle.  Safe neighborhood. Great find! Worth the money."

Sono andato in vacanza in una bella citta' con tanto amore insieme a mia moglie ma poi mi sono ritrovato a soggiornare in una camera che non avrei mai immaginato che fosse cosi' ...muri neri spennellato di bianco finestra rotta dove passa l'aria e forse in inverno non sarebbe il massimo , frigorifero e microonde sporchi di nero, letto  quello di una vecchia prigione , parquet nero, piastrelle rotte. Forse per la camera puo' bastare , praticamente le foto che vedete dell'host risalgono a quando praticamente si e' costruito questo appartamento .Il bagno non ne parliamo il bordo vasco e' di uno spessore di 3 cm nero, e c'era una spugna che era in uno stato di putrefazione! Praticamente potevo beccare qualche malattia.Comunque non voglio allungarmi scrivendo quello che ho trascorso in 5 notti in quella orrenda casa , vi dico solo di stare lontano da questa casa e non accettate nemmeno se il prezzo e' bassissimo perche' la vostra vacanza sara' rovinata!!! Mi dispiace che non posso mettere le foto di quella casa ORRIBILE senno' non c'era bisogno nemmeno di scrivere , attenzione che io ho scritto questo ma in realta' e' molto peggio e dico cosi' perche' non ci potete credere se non vivendo l'esperienza che ho fatto io!!   colgo l'occasione per ringraziare i membri di airbnb che sono stati eccezionali!

We had to wait for over half an hour around the corner in a local restaurant....this is not something we wanted to after many hours of flying. It also seemed this happened to the couple staying after us but for a considerably longer time. Aside from that nothing bad to say.

So I feel asleep within an hour after arriving at his apartment and didn't wake up until the next morning.  Which goes to show that the room faces a quiet street and that the bed is comfortable, even if a metal frame.  The room is as it looks in the photo, with the additions of a table cloth, cups, mugs and a small mirror, without the plant, stool and dark full length curtain, now replaced by a shorter one that lets the light through it.  Shunichi was very communicative about my move in and had no problem with me coming earlier than I initially indicated,nor with me leaving my luggage at his place until I left the city the following day.

We did not see Shunichi a lot, since he has quite a reserved/private personality.Let's start with the real good things; first is location, location and location. Perfect for the ultimate new york trip! We visited all the highlights; far locations like statue of liberty and yankee stadium by subway. All other things we did walking or by hoponhopoff bus. Also the flexibility of Shunichi is great; we had all the things we needed; a fridge, microwave, shower always available at our times, etc.When reading the comments we noticed some comments about the pictures and cleanness. Well those are true; the room is maybe not as nice or clean as shown on the pictures, but what do you aspect for this rate? If you want a perfect room book a 4 star hotel for triple the price. This room is perfect for budget minded travellers (like us). The only times we were in the room was for sleeping.We'd certainly recommend this location for those looking for this type of stay."

Das Essensangebot in der Umgebung ist reichhaltig. Direkt gegenÃ_ber ist eine Parkgarage - interessant fÃ_r Mietwagennehmer.Die Wohnung selbst riecht sauber, die BÃ¶den, die Toiette und das Waschbecken waren stets picobello.Die Wohnung befindet sich allerdings in einem stark renovierungsbedÃ_rftigen Zustand. Dies betrifft vor allem das Bad mit starkem Schimmelbefall rund um die schlecht funktionierende Dusche, sowie das desolate GÃ_stezimmer. Die WÃ_nde sind rissig und fleckig. Die Sauberkeit rund um Mikrowelle und KÃ_hlschrank laden nicht zur Essenszubereitung ein. Die MÃ¶bel haben ihre besten Zeiten lÃ_ngst hinter sich. Die Kopfkissen riechen wie das Basecap eines Teenagers. BettenbezÃ_ge waren wahrscheinlich gewaschen, trotzdem voller Flecken. Wir haben uns eigene Kopfkissen und neue BettwÃ_sche gekauft. Fazit: wem der Zustand der Wohnung egal ist, und kein Problem mit Schimmel im Bad hat, sollte sich sein eigenes Bettzeug mitbringen und die tolle Lage der Wohnung genieÃŸen! Shunichi scheint ein ordentlicher Typ zu sein, obwohl wir Ihn nicht persÃ¶nlich angetroffen hatten. Er war zwar ab und zu anwesend, scheint aber nicht am Kontakt mit seinen GÃ_sten interessiert zu sein. Abolut O.K. fÃ_r uns! Seine Katze ist jedenfalls supersÃ_ÃŸ und sehr viel kontaktfreudiger ;-)"
934,5178,56178557,12/10/15,30565244,Xin,"We loved the host's helpfulness and location, but not so much the lack of cleanliness in our room and the bathroom. The picture on Airbnb is quite misleading in this aspect. Though there were many amenities (fridge, TV, heater etc) in the room, they were all overed with thick layers of dust. The whole place smelled musty. The shelves were grimy, we had to wipe them down ourselves. There was also lots of hair strands on the duvet, but thankfully no bugs. There is also no lift, so if you have large luggage, it's quite a hassle up the stairs.If the actual room had matched the clean looking Airbnb photo, we would not have taken issue. I hope that the host will either maintain a better upkeep of the room and bathroom for future guests."
935,5178,57110749,12/22/15,12393587,Nicci,"Shunichi war ein sehr freundlicher Host, aber die Wohnung war nicht wirklich einladend. Im Bad war sehr starker Schimmelbefall und unter sauber versteht man auch etwas anderes. Auch die Dusche war nicht wirklich zufriedenstellend , da die Temperatureinstellung nicht richtig funktionierte.Das Zimmer war auch nicht wirklich besser. Es befindet sich in einem stark renovierungsbedÃ_rftigen Zustand. Flecken an der Decke, dreckige WÃ_nde und auch auch der Bereich, wo der KÃ_hlschrank und die Mikrowelle stehen, ist sehr keimig. Leider hatten wir im frisch bezogenem Bett ( wir hoffen es zumindest ) sowie auf den Ãœberdecken lange dunkle Haare. Shunichi war aber so freundlich und hat die Decken dann ausgetauscht. Auch unter dem Bett waren Ansammlungen von Haaren :-/Die Lage der Wohnung ist aber perfekt.Wem Schimmel und Unsauberkeit nichts ausmacht, kann hier gÃ_nstig unterkommen."

But he planned everything for our stay in the bedroom he prepared for us. It was near everything in Manhattan (especially time square and hell's kitchen). It was perfect for our short trip. "
937,5178,57437014,12/26/15,11808135,Ritisha,"I stayed here with 2 of my friends for 2 days. The booking was for 2 people, but we had a last min change of plan and Shunichi was nice enough to accommodate 3 of us. The place, however, was not at all like the description/photos. It was an ok neighborhood, the stairs to the place were extremely dusty and smelly. The room was also very dusty and old. They also have a cat which was not mentioned. I am prone to allergies, and ended up having a running nose during the trip. Both me and my friend had sore throats by the end of it. We didn't use the kitchen at all, but it didn't seem very inviting either. The bathroom was just ok. I would probably not book that place again. "
938,5178,58257109,1/2/16,26716678,Shermeen,Clean and large room. The location of the apt was superb! Really convenient if you want to catch Broadway shows. There are also lots of good food in the area. Shunichi was a very accommodating and polite host.

940,5178,60256899,1/21/16,46275994,Ramon,"The location is definitely fantastic and is the reason we choose to stay here. They are very quiet so you feel almost like they're not there.Unfortunately, everything else (whilst as described) is pretty ordinary.There was no one to meet us despite advising previously of our arrival time to JFK. We had to wait in the freezing cold for around 45mins and then when his friend got there to let us in, we had to wait while they prepared the room. They didn't change the top two blankets which was a bit gross. There was also a general unclean smell throughout.The internet is slow (when it's working) and the shower is truly awful - you either get third degree burns or pneumonia.It's a shame because the setup is pretty good, and the place could be brilliant with a bit of TLC - but then it would definitely cost a lot more.In general, location is unbeatable but the accommodation itself isn't great."

The room and bathroom were very clean.  Although our schedules never coincided for us to meet, everything was just as expected and even more considerations, like extra bathroom necessities in our room if we had forgotten anything, tea and a hot water kettle, etc.  I will definitely consider staying again and will recommend to others."

But the neighborhood was very comfortable and the location of the room is convenient. I think that this is a good room for summer (because heating is not working very much) and if you want a room in Manhattan near some of the best attractions and at good price

In meno di 5 minuti a piedi si arriva a Central Park o a due differenti fermate della metro.Per il resto l'appartamento Ã¨ piccolo, spesso odora di chiuso e, non si puÃ_ definire sporco, ma quanto meno poco curato e anche poco accogliente. Tutto sommato perÃ_ se si usa solo ed esclusivamente come base per andare a dormire vale affidarsi al prezzo e alla convenienza della zona.Per quanto riguarda Shunichi, Ã¨ molto disponibile anche se molto riservato, per avere una conversazione con lui Ã¨ necessario andare a bussare alla sua porta (ognuno valuti se sia un elemento positivo o meno!), ma per ogni problema Ã¨ disponibile.Le regole della casa, in conclusione, permetterebbero l'utilizzo della cucina in qualsiasi motivo lui non sia in casa. Noi siamo stati una settimana intera e lo abbiamo sempre trovato in casa, per cui se la vostra idea Ã¨ quella di avere la possibilitÃ  di cucinare non vi consiglio questo appartamento. In caso contrario un po' alla buona, ma la posizione Ã¨ ottima!"

Fue una convivencia tranquila. A partir del cuarto dÃ_a de nuestra estadÃ_a, el wifi dejÃ_ de funcionar y estuvimos sin internet hasta el Ãºltimo dÃ_a. Las fotos publicadas no coinciden con el estado real de la habitaciÃ_n y departamento. El departamento se encuentra muy sucio, con acumulaciÃ_n de cosas en los espacios comunes, estÃ¡ desordenado y muy deteriorado, con mobiliarios rotos en la habitaciÃ_n, enchufes con los cables saliendo para afuera, el piso sucio y todo rayado, las ventanas sucias, la cajonera tambiÃ©n rota. No es un lugar habitable, no volverÃ_a bajo ninguna circunstancia. De hecho las fotos publicadas al momento de mi reserva eran otras, las de ahora se ven mucho peor y la realidad es aÃºn peor. El baÃ±o sucio, el agua de la ducha fue imposible de graduar, o frÃ_a o hirviendo, y mala presiÃ_n de agua. La cocina nada que ver con la foto, muy sucia, con cantidad de cosas acumuladas, tierra y olor. Muy desagradable en general. El departamento estÃ¡ abandonado, sucio, desordenado, deteriorado. A pesar de pasar todo el dÃ_a afuera y de la buena ubicaciÃ_n, no se justifica reservar este departamento para dormir, es imposible baÃ±arse, usar el baÃ±o cÃ_modo y dormir tranquilo debido al desorden y la suciedad, es muy incÃ_modo dormir ahÃ_, con un acolchado muy sucio y que no dan ganas de usar ni de tocar.Aclaro que yo reservÃ© el hospedaje porque leÃ_ muchos comentarios buenos, pero leyendo los comentarios de los Ãºltimos tiempos empezaron a aparecer comentarios negativos y ahora el mio. Lamento haber reservado, esos comentarios positivos no tuvieron nada que ver con mi experiencia.La ubicaciÃ_n fue lo UNICO bueno del hospedaje, y no justifica su reserva. Aclaro que me he hospedado en hostels y lugares muy bÃ¡sicos y sencillos, pero cÃ_modos, acogedores y limpios, no se necesita mucho pero si lo bÃ¡sico, y acÃ¡ no lo encontrÃ©.Lamento ser dura, pero prefiero contar mi experiencia sinceramente y que otros puedan evitarse malas experiencias. Y si me preguntan por quÃ© me quede, es obvio, porque salir a buscar hospedaje era imposible por los costos elevados que se manejan en Manhattan."

The bed was comfortable, and it was easy to feel at home and relaxed in the room. Both the room and the bathroom had plenty of space, and was nice and clean.The location in Manhattan was very central and close to many things, while still being relatively calm at night. We also found that there was an abundance of good restaurants literally right around the corner, which was a great luxury. The most difficult thing was to chose just one place to eat at after a long day of sightseeing!  I would reccommend booking this room to anyone who wants to go to NYC, it definitely contributed to making our NYC experience amazing!"

Shunichi was very friendly and ready to help should I need it. Enjoyed my stay a lot and would definitely stay again :)
962,5178,84488860,7/7/16,46023317,Francisco,"My stay at this apartment was not the best experience, but if what you care about the most is a great location, then this is the place for you. The picture is a good reference of what to expect, although simply add an unpleasant layer of grime to everything and you have a more accurate idea. My main issue was that the room, while tidy, felt unclean and the bathroom was unpleasantly dirty, to say the least. The apartment looks really worn and it is right next to the trash room, so opening the door you smell the trash and it can be pretty disgusting. However, the inside of the apartment smelled fine. I appreciated that the room is independent of the owner's space, as a door separates the room and the bathroom from the living room and the owner's room. It was also very convenient that the room came with a fridge, microwave, toaster, and even plates and cutlery. It is pleasantly large and the bed was more of a full-sized futon. The a/c worked, but not very well, which is not an inconvenience unless one comes in the summertime like I did. Our host provided us with a room key, so it was nice to be able to lock the room and feel my stuff would not be disturbed. I didn't really see much of the owner, as a friend of his welcomed me when I arrived, and I believe that if I hadn't proceeded to ask him a few questions the one day I saw him at the apartment, we might never have talked, as he always left before I did and arrived apparently after. However, the main thing about this apartment is the location. Incredible location! It is walking distance from  Columbus Circle and all the theater area and Times Square, which made it very convenient when I got out of a play late at night. There are also a number of grocery stores nearby, including an organic whole foods style one. There are nearby subway stations and tons of restaurants, so it is easy to find anything one might need within a few blocks."
963,5178,86350734,7/16/16,78804951,John,Perfect location for the show I was seeing- thanks to the host for offering this.
964,5178,86591242,7/17/16,48344389,Arianna,"The person (host's friend) that was supposed to let us in the apartment at the schedule time wasn't there, so we had to wait almost an hour, until the previous guest open the door for us. That person was still in the room, sheets all messy, dirty towels on the bed...nasty view. The host was already on his way to receive us due to the fact that his friend never showed up. He apologized and was quick to ""prepare the room"". Honestly, the fact that we had to wait wasn't that big of a deal, hiccups happen. But the fact that after he prepare the room, it continued to look messy and dirty was kind of disappointing. To all of you looking to stay in NYC, be aware of Pros and Cons of this listing! Pros: location is excellent! Good neighborhood, very close to Central Park by Columbus Circle, lots of nice restaurants and shops nearby. This is what this listing is about. Also, he provided with maps, hairdryer, sun screen, scissors and that kind of essentials. There was a small working fridge, instant coffee, microwave and TV, which I don't know if they worked, never used them.  Cons: On the other hand, the room and bathroom were really dirty, mostly the bathroom. Guys, I had to grab a cleaning brush and a bottle of cleaning product that was next to the toilet to clean the bathtub floor, because I didn't dare to put my feet there, considering on how the rest of the bathroom looked. The sheets looked clean, but we didn't dare to use the towels, we just used small ones that we packed just in case. The cover on the small sofa was also pretty nasty. Honestly, this is not a place to stay more than one night, and that's why we decided to stay after seeing all this. If it would had been more that one night, we would have gone to our friend's house in New Jersey, which it'd had ruined all our plans. Bottom line: If you don't mind staying relatively cheap in the middle of the city, in a dirty place, this the listing to do so. At least neighborhood is safe. Otherwise, go to a different place, you got to be a care-free person to stay in a place like this, and have seen many dirty places to assimilate this. I come from a dirty 3rd world country, so there's that. But never expected this in an Air bnb listing, mind you, is my first experience :( Good luck to you all! P.S: The $15 cleaning fee are not being used towards that, I guarantee it!"
965,5178,86764854,7/17/16,17721404,Na,Everything was great! Perfect location! So close to Central Park & Broadway. Also super flexible with leaving our luggage for the day! Good value accommodation. Thanks!

967,5178,89925046,7/30/16,46645494,Flor,"My whole experience at Shunichi's place was perfect! Check in was easy. I just let him know about what time I was expected to arrive and he arranged a friend to let me in and provide me the keys. You can't beat the location. It's only a few blocks away from the Columbus Circle subway station, which is right next to Central Park. One block south is an NYPD station, so the neighborhood is fairly safe. Around the corner is Mariella's Pizza, which I highly recommend. There are several 24 hour stores in the area for your convenience. The room is very spacious and is perfect for one person, but it can accommodate two people comfortably. The mini fridge was very useful and the air conditioner worked adequately, especially during summer.  The bathroom was clean and functional and towels were provided. I stayed here for a whole week and actually saw Shunichi only one time and waved hello, so I had my privacy the entire time of my stay. I really enjoyed my stay here. In fact, if I ever do return to NYC, this is the first place I'll check to find a place to stay."

And I would also like to explain that I traveled with my boyfriend, and were all day out walking, so we didn't need to stay in the room during the day.Pros: location is great, in the middle of the city. Shunichi is almost always out or inside his space, so you won't feel controlled. The bed was as announced and host offers a few more things as scissors, shampoos, some cuttlery, things that may come in handy. Cons: room is tidy, but is quite dark (curtains could be washed too). Air conditioner works, but makes a lot of noise during the night (and you'll need it in hot summer). Bathroom is clean as far as you can see, but if you glance a little further, you'll notice some dirty spots. My towel was a bit dirty also, I had to use my bf's. Apt is on first floor (consider that if you carry heavy luggage). What seems to be living room is stacked with boxes and things -I understand is his place after all, but it may shock you when you enter. And kitchen is definitely a no to use it.However, Shunichi is very respectful and shy, so he won't mess around you but will help you get the best out your stay.

981,5178,112831476,11/7/16,467394,Jeannie,"Shunichi's place was perfect for my purposes. I needed a quiet place to sleep before the New York marathon. Check in was smooth. He's very quiet and private and we didn't speak or interact at all except at check in. This room is large and spacious and was perfect for a single traveler. It's a perfect location in Manhattan, close to everything you need. There's a small dorm refrigerator and microwave, toaster and hot pot in the room - much more than I expected. It's not a full kitchen but it was plenty. The bathroom is shared between the two rooms. Everything was great. "

The location was great, and check-in was convenient with his friend. My train arrived late to Penn Station, and his friend still met me despite the delay. I was able to leave my luggage until mid-afternoon on the day of check-out, which eased my travel around the the city. I did not use the fridge, microwave, toaster, nor A/C, and I did not enter the kitchen. As mentioned in the description, it can be noisy at night. I would also echo others' sentiments that the cleanliness could be improved."

It was extremely appreciated that we were able to drop off our bags early (the morning of our check in) and pick up our bags in the evening (the evening of our check out)! A good place to stay if you're looking for flexible times and the basics."
986,5178,115782894,11/26/16,4162253,Shermine,"Shunichi's place is in a great location and affordably priced. It is difficult to find such value in New York. While we did not interact much with him, he was helpful when we had questions. He also allowed us to leave our luggages there after check-out. If you are mostly out of the room and only back at night for rest, this room is definitely more than sufficient!"

The room was clean, although everything including the bed was very old. The only problem was the bathroom, It was very disgusting seeing different types of hairs everywhere. "
989,5178,126059728,1/8/17,53538599,Cynth,"Mon amie et moi-mÃªme avons profitÃ© de l'appartement de Suchini durant 15 jours (du 26/12/16 au 08/01/17). J'ai beaucoup hÃ©sitÃ© pour la note entre 3 et 4 mais finalement j'ai tranchÃ© sur un 3 et je m'explique tout de suite. Tout d'abord parlons des points positifs : - l'appartement a une situation idÃ©ale, Ã  5 min de Central Park, Ã  10 minutes de Time Square. Le top ! On Ã©tait Ã  proximitÃ© de tout : de boutiques souvenirs, de restaurants, de fast-foods, de Columbus Circle oÃ_ on peut faire ses courses facilement, bref parfait ! - la chambre est vraiment spacieuse (avec mon amie on s'est vraiment Ã©talÃ©, et oui on est des filles :p, mais on Ã©tait vraiment Ã  lâ€™aise) et des Ã©quipements Ã  dispo un frigo, un micro-onde, de la vaisselle, une TV (un peu sensible avec l'antenne), un Wi-Fi un peu capricieux parfois avec notre ordinateur, quelques nÃ©cessaires de toilette, des plans de NY Ã  dispo... - la cuisine est Ã  dispo et Ã  tout ce qu'il faut pour se cuisiner des repas rapides (cela change des fast-foods Ã  gogo :)) - la salle de bain est spacieuse Ã©galement. Pas de petite salle de bain toute riquiqui, non il y a de la place dans la douche, pour se prÃ©parer, pour utiliser le lavaboâ€_ Mais malheureusement il y a quand mÃªme quelques points nÃ©gatifs Ã  retenir et pas des moindres comme : - la propretÃ© en gÃ©nÃ©ral. Nous ne sommes pas regardantes avec mon amie sur 2-3 poils qui pourraient se trouver dans une douche ou un grain de poussiÃ¨re dans l'appartement. Mais lÃ  c'Ã©tait vraiment trÃ¨s limite, sans parler de la vÃ©tustÃ© de l'appart, la salle de bain Ã©tait vraiment borderline avec des poils, des cheveux, de la poussiÃ¨re par terre, le lavabo n'Ã©tait pas nettoyÃ©, je doute que le tapis soit lavÃ© par exemple aussi. Et dans la cuisine, la plaque de gaz Ã©tait grasse, noire de saletÃ©... Dans la chambre, on aurait apprÃ©ciÃ© des draps propres entre ces deux semaines, le sol nâ€™Ã©tait pas vraiment propre, et le frigo nâ€™Ã©tait pas nettoyÃ©. Bref nous Ã©tions vraiment dÃ©Ã§ues par rapport Ã  cela. Et je reprÃ©cise que pourtant nous ne sommes pas difficiles en rÃ¨gle gÃ©nÃ©rale. - la salle de bain. En plus d'Ãªtre trÃ¨s vieille (des barres de douche rouillÃ©es, des murs moisis, une vieille plomberie), prendre une douche Ã©tait vraiment un calvaire. Une fois brÃ»lante et une fois glacÃ©e, on arrivait Ã  rÃ©gler l'eau une fois sur 10. Et autant dire que c'est frustrant de pas pouvoir prendre une douche correcte quand on a marchÃ© toute la journÃ©e et qu'on est crevÃ©. Enfin dernier point, plutÃ´t mitigÃ© - la communication avec lâ€™hÃ´te. Alors certes lâ€™hÃ´te est trÃ¨s discret et pour des gens comme moi qui prÃ©fÃ¨re cela aux personnes envahissantes, câ€™Ã©tait parfait. NÃ©anmoins mon amie a regrettÃ© le fait de ne pas avoir parfois des infos, des recommandations (nous nous ne sommes mÃªme pas souhaitÃ©s la bonne annÃ©e, câ€™est quand mÃªme dommage quand deux..."

Walking distance of Times Square, Central Park and if you don't mind a 45 minute walk to the Freedom Tower. Lots of really good places to eat near by. Shunichi is very private and a nice guy. Bathroom could be a bit cleaner however everything else was great. Really good value for money. Would recommend. "
1003,5178,155171634,5/27/17,7332702,Katharina,"Shunichi is a reliable host who does his best to support his guests in all questions. Also the room is equipped with the most necessary things and even a helpful travel guide. His flat is a great starting point for all explorations whether up- or downton, just 4 blocks south of the central park.Only drawback is the noise of the street, but I didn't really expect anything else in such a central position.We really enjoyed our stay!"

We choose this place because it is really close to the theater we were going to. Check in was hassle free, the room was perfect for what we needed for one night. Clean and tidy. The bed was really comfortable. We didn't meet the  host but his communication was always really quick.There was a bit of noise at night but it is the middle of Manhattan so you have to expect that. We left early the following morning so traffic noise wasn't an issue for us. Would recommend this place to a couple who want to spend there day exploring the city. It is really good value for money. I would stay here again. Thanks"

The air conditioner was the disappointing part of it all. We got there before the sun went down and had to leave because it was just that hot in the room. No fan was available. It was hot in the city and very uncomfortable to sleep. This was my first airbnb experience.

We had an issue with our flight and he was flexible with our checkout time which helped us out a lot. Could not have been happier with our stay here!"
1014,5178,178509640,8/5/17,106500549,Sydney,"Shunichi's place is wonderful if you are just looking for a place to sleep and shower in while you are visiting Manhattan. It is close to Central Park and Times Square. It fit my needs perfectly, as I was doing very touristy things and only was in the apartment at night. Shunuchi was very accommodating. My flight was delayed and I arrived to check in 3 hours after I had planned to and he was still very kind! He even allowed me to come back a few days later and pick up one of the shopping bags that I left there! I would definitely recommend Shunichi as a host."

I walk a lot and had no problems going to Pier 83 or the entire Central Park and Times Square. While it may not be the cleanest pla ce in the world, it certainly didn't raise any issues with me. If you want spotless living quarters, get a fancy hotel. Shunichi provided a comfortable room with a tv, DVD player(remote needs batteries), Small fridge, microwave oven, and other appliances such as a toaster, etc. There is also a closet and a shelf-system that is perfect for your clothes. Shunichi was very prompt in replying to texts when I got to town and near his residence. He helped me carry my luggage up the 1 flight of stairs and when I made an inquiry about salt, he was at my door within 2 minutes. And that was all I saw of my host the entire week. It was like I was all alone the entire week. Since I am not a Social Butterfly around strangers, it was perfect for me. Price was VERY reasonable for staying in NYC. Thank you."

The bed linen is not very clean there are a bit spots on it, but the bed is fine. The bathroom is okay but the sprinkler has mold on it, so as the ladder of the apartment."

1026,5178,204762021,10/19/17,10235580,Beth,"For $70/night a few blocks from Times Square....you canâ€™t beat it. Here is what I found recently (mid October, 2017). Shunichi went out of his way (via text) to accommodate my late morning arrival (before he had a chance to clean from another guest who had not even left yet). I met him at his employment where he gave me keys and directions for setting my bags down in his living room. From Penn Station to his place, a taxi would normally cost about $10 (including tip). From Penn to his employment (opposite direction) and then to his place was about $30 total. Easy to walk the distance(s) if you do not have heavy bags to carry (I did). I would say his neighborhood is quite safe.Basic needs are in the room. If you expect super basic you will not be disappointed, if you expect â€œstyle,â€ù then this is not a place for you. I would say that is it clean â€œenough,â€ù but I did not take a shower. Keys: the key to locks of both building entrance doors (2) are not well aligned. I struggled for a couple of minutes, almost called him (and I canâ€™t really say what to do to get it to work). Key to apt. itself is fine.Never having stayed in downtown NYC, I was interested to learn about noise. Sunichiâ€™s place is about 6 houses in from a main drag (8th Street) and on the second floor. I was impressed with how little I heard from the outside (with the window open a couple of inches), only an occasional siren on 8th (main drag). I slept in until 8:30...sweet!Would I stay there again? I would consider it, but Iâ€™d look around for another possibility, too."
1027,5178,206294390,10/24/17,61302838,Holly,"Was what I expected! Basic room but everything I needed. He provided clean towels which was great, and the door to the bedroom locked making me feel extra safe when I left my things behind to go explore. Had an issue reaching him at checkin which made me nervous, especially as I was a solo traveller in the evening, but once I met him and was able to checkin I felt super comfortable!"

1029,5178,211649667,11/13/17,79392314,John,He was really accommodating on my early flight arrival and late departure. His place is close to a lot of restaurants which was good since I am a foodie. If youâ€™re not there is a McDonalds/ wendys across the street. His place is like 12 min away from Times Square. The neighborhood is safe to walk around.

If you aren't looking to spend too much time there, it is a terrific option. Shunichi is organised and a good communicator, and we found it very straighforward. Would stay again."

1046,5178,250545834,4/5/18,179339844,Lila Anna,Host was extremely accommodating with early and late check in/out. Great location. Building and room a bit old and cluttered...reminded me of my back packing days in Europe!

Schimmel wohin das Auge reicht im Badezimmer, verdreckte Zimmer im allgemeinen und der Geruch war undefinierbar. Es tut mir sehr leid aber ich kann nur sagen, nie nie wieder!"
1048,5178,257303817,4/25/18,41944389,Luz,"Desafortunadamente no pudimos conocer a Shunichi, nos hubiera gustado saber con quiÃ©n estÃ¡bamos compartiendo piso, el lugar no esta mal, pero en las fotos se ve mucho mÃ¡s iluminado y ordenado de lo que en realidad estÃ¡. No tuvimos ningÃºn problema, pero tampoco hubo nada especial que podamos comentar, lo Ãºnico que destacÃ_ fue la ubicaciÃ_n, a pocas cuadras de central park y de times square."
1049,5178,259258828,4/30/18,20372891,Geneva,"What a fabulous apartment! Perfect for the theatre-lover, as you are minutes walk from the best Broadway theatres. Shunichi gives you lots of privacy and the apartment is tidy and full of great touches. The listing is very straightforward, but I would argue that itâ€™s better than the description! I recommend earplugs because there is street noise but you will get that anywhere in NYC! I will stay here again when I visit NYC."
1050,5178,266166390,5/19/18,110055350,Maico,Excelente relaciÃ_n precio/ubicaciÃ_n. Estas a dos cuadras de Columbus Circle con todos los transportes a mano y cerca de todo y con Hellâ€™s Kitchen a mano para comer todas las noches. Nos manejamos siempre a pie sin problemas. No pretendan limpieza o lujos pero si privacidad ya que el anfitriÃ_n prÃ¡cticamente nunca estuvo presente. NingÃºn problema en particular y flexible con los horarios de checkin y checkout asÃ_ que lugar recomendado (excepto para obsesivos con la limpieza a los cuales les sugiero pagar el doble un hotel)
1051,5178,270037571,5/28/18,53685014,Gonzalo,"La ubicaciÃ_n es inmejorable, se encuentra cerca del Central Park y Time Square. Muy cÃ_modo para moverse en subte.El apartamento se encuentra en una calle tranquila, la habitaciÃ_n es para pasar la noche pero limpia y la cama es muy cÃ_moda.Al anfitriÃ_n lo vimos solo dos veces ya que trabaja todo el dÃ_a.Sin lugar a dudas volverÃ_a a hospedarme. Lo recomiendo 100%"
1052,5178,271525828,6/1/18,61334816,Braden,"Location is fantastic, and Bread & Honey store around corner amongst others provides ample amenities nearby.  Street noise broke sleep first night, despite fan -- then I adjusted but, as noted, it's present.  Bed was fine and large room with closet and desk makes for a good situation.  Bathroom is the only other room you have access to, but kettle and small fridge in bedroom makes it workable.  As noted, this is basic -- think dorm-room style -- then remind yourself again about the location; neighborhood felt safe even at night.  2nd floor with lots of stairs but also high ceiling in room of this old building. Host was prompt on communication and exceptionally quiet. "
1053,5178,273006060,6/4/18,108018206,Kirsten,"Shunichi was an accomodating, respectful and friendly host. The apartment is nice, in walking distance of Central Park, and public transport in all parts of town easily accessible. There's at least four Starbucks, a Whole Foods and several 24-h pharmacies/stores in close vicinity. If you want to see New York, this is an awesome homebase. Would definitely recommend and stay there again."
1054,5178,276035158,6/12/18,155109016,Natalia,"As the description says, don't expect luxuries. The room is okay and the bathroom is not the best but it works if you don't expect much and are there just to sleep at night and take a shower. The host was barely visible so you don't have to worry about him being in the way. We didn't get to use the kitchen but we never asked either so we don't know if it wasn't allowed at all. Overall, the location is great. There are a couple of subways, restaurants and markets to buy breakfast nearby. Not far from Times Square and Broadway. Shunichi was great at answering all questions we had so I really recommend to stay at his place while in New York."
1055,5178,279084296,6/19/18,19828093,Jorge,"Lo mejor la ubicaciÃ_n, excelente. La casa no es acogedora ni limpia, pero la habitaciÃ_n es amplia, esta ordenada y tiene un sofa sucio q cubrimos con una manta del avion para usarlo. AdemÃ¡s de la ubicaciÃ_n, tienes absoluta privacidad, a veces no sabes si Shunichi estÃ¡ en casa, entras y sales sin problema. La cama esta muy bien y las sabanas estaban limpias. La ducha no estaba limpÃ_sima pero las he visto mucho peores, es aceptable ducharse ahÃ_ si piensas en lo barato del alojamiento y el sitio en el q estÃ¡. Si vas a New York para estar todo el dia en la calle, y pasar el tiempo justo en el alojamiento para dormir descansar y ducharte es una opcion barata que te gustarÃ¡. Yo repetirÃ_a! No es apto para prÃ_ncipes y princesas pero estÃ¡s en pleno Manhattan por muy poco dinero. Shunichi es agradable y muy escueto, tuvimos un problema con una llave y lo solucionÃ_ rapidamente. Todo fue correcto."
1056,5178,280153286,6/22/18,182125003,Jimmy,"Shunichi offers a place to stay in Manhattan without the huge cost. He was very accommodating for early checking and checkouts. Granted, it could use an interior makover, but it was comfortable, quiet and close to shops, restaurants, and the Subway.  I see it already booked for the rest of the year, so I recommend you book early for next summer."

Zudem fehlte an 2 von 7 Tagen warmes Wasser und im Bad befanden sich einige gebrauchte Ãœberreste an Rasierern, Duschgels etc. von vorherigen GÃ_sten - auch nicht sehr lecker. Die ausgeschriebene KÃ_che war extrem verdreckt, was aber eigentlich keine Rolle spielte, da der Raum, in dem sie sich befand, nicht zugÃ_nglich und somit fÃ_r uns nicht nutzbar war. Wir wurden in jenem Raum kurz â€_geparktâ€˜, als eine â€_Freundinâ€˜, von ihm, die uns auch in Empfang nahm, bei unserer Ankunft erst einmal unser Zimmer sauber machte.. das aber auch eher sporadisch. Die Klimaanlage im â€_Schlafzimmerâ€˜ funktionierte zwar, das jedoch eher halblebig; ein kÃ_hles Zimmer hatten wir jedenfalls nicht, und das sehr zu unserem Leidwesen, da es im New Yorker Hochsommer dringend nÃ¶tig gewesen wÃ_re.Wir mussten ihm am Anreisetag nach mehrfachem Anschreiben hinterher telefonieren, wann wir das Zimmer denn jetzt beziehen dÃ_rfen. Obwohl er jeden Abend zu Hause war kam kein einziger persÃ¶nlicher Kontakt zu Stande, was wir sehr schade und auch befremdlich fanden, da wir ja TÃ_r an TÃ_r wohnten. Check-Out Belange klÃ_rte er dann auch lieber Ã_ber die App, sprich die Gastgeberrolle wurde hier nicht wirklich wahrgenommen.Der Preis war fÃ_r diese tolle Lage unglaublich gut, alles andere jedoch hat einen nicht zum Verweilen verleiten kÃ¶nnen. Mehr als â€_geschlafenâ€˜, unser GepÃ_ck geparkt und geduscht haben wir dort nicht."

1061,5178,305620124,8/11/18,51623909,Vy,"Looking for a good place to crash for a few days at Shunichi's place is a good idea. Though it was very hot and hard to sleep, Shunichi provided us with another air con and it worked well. The bathroom had some stains, grime and mold. There were old curtains but it got the job done. The bedroom was dusty and dark but the bed was a good size and the host/host's friend provided us more blankets and pillows if needed. Overall, for the price and location, it's definitely a steal. But the cleanliness can be worked on. "

El pasillo estaba lleno de trastos y olÃ_a un poco a humedad (es un bloque de edificios antiguo). Por otro lado, Shunichi fue muy educado aunque distante, como si no estuviese en casa. Nos dio facilidades para dejar la maleta en el pasillo el Ãºltimo dÃ_a hasta que cogimos el aviÃ_n. Lo mÃ¡s importante del apartamento es que estÃ¡ muy bien situado (entre Central Park y Times Square). Si no eres muy escrupuloso por lo del baÃ±o (y te llevas unas chanclas), en general estÃ¡ bien para lo que pagas. Si eres muy fino, busca otro."

Have been to NYC for 5 times and stayed at those dirty hotels in midtown before but I have to say this is the best experience that I've ever had. What a loving family. They always prepare sth in the morning, like croissants, coffee and Maryellen's chocolate croissants is amazing! Bed is comfy. Bathroom is right in front of my room. I got to use it a lot even though I was sharing with the kids. 4 Kids are very friendly and well behave. Abby, the 5 years old one is adorable! #1 subway is just 5 mins away and I feel safe even when I got home alone late at night. Would love to come back!

But my experience was very, very positive--much more like stopping with an old college friend you stayed in touch with over the years than a night at a conventional hotel.  Sadly, I never actually got to meet Maryellen--our paths just didn't cross--but I did meet several other members of the family, all of them funny and brainy and welcoming.  It was a hot night, and when I came back after my night at the theater the AC was on and the room was cool.  I hadn't slept on a twin in years, but the bed was very comfortable and after a day of traveling I had no trouble falling asleep right away.  And I was provided with a couple of excellent cups of coffee in the morning (my breakfast of choice).  A great deal in a very fine part of town."
1104,5203,347689,7/2/11,607989,Dyana,Terrific place to stay in NYC. Warm and inviting. The Lehmann's are incredibly helpful and accommodating. I highly recommend staying here!
1105,5203,375816,7/16/11,607989,Dyana,"Gracious, warm and welcoming! My mother came to NYC to help me care for my baby for the summer and stayed with the Lehmann family. It was an ideal situation for her. She was welcomed into their home with warmth and kindness though also left to to come and go as she needed to. She has already been back and will continue to stay with them when she visits! Thank you very much!"

1109,5203,591931,10/3/11,944140,Katie,"I had a perfect stay with the Lehmann family. They were so inviting and helpful, and the room was perfect (bathroom right across the hall), clean, quiet, private and the bed was really comfortable. The location is also great - a nice neighborhood, not far from central park and very close to a couple subway stops. If you're looking for an inviting place to stay when visiting NY on your own I would recommend staying here without hesitation. "
1110,5203,596449,10/4/11,582867,MÃ©lodie,"My stay at Mary Ellen's place was short but sweet ! I felt very welcomed and she was incredibly warm ! I was provided breakfast, the bed was comfortable and clean. Oh and one great thing : the subway was very close ! I highly recommend this apartment."
1111,5203,636771,10/17/11,1151870,Colleen,This was my first experience with airbnb and I was very happy with how it worked out.  I felt awkward at first being in the Lehmann's home but they could not have been more welcoming or gracious.  The room was exactly as advertised and the location was perfect for me - so close to Columbia.  I highly recommend this room and am looking forward to staying here again.
1112,5203,786937,12/15/11,176018,Dorothy,I can't say enough about how wonderful it is to stay with the Lehman's.  I stay with them about once a month and it is such a pleasure to have so lovely a place to stay.
1113,5203,873268,1/20/12,896929,Ute,"Although I was arriving 3 hours later than scheduled ( plane delay) Maryellen kindly welcomed me to her lovely home, showed me the room and handed me a key. There is a very friendly door man who helped getting the suitcase from the taxi into the elevator. The bed is comfy, the robe clean and cuddely and the coffee next morning was excellent. It was a special joy to meet some of Marellen's children and see them work on school assignments or hear them play the piano.I went on a long morning walk in Riverside Park, which is just 5 minutes by foot from the house and later used the subway station 110/Broadway (just 2 short blocks). I felt very safe in the neighborhood.Since my plane left late the following day I was allowed to leave my suitcase for later pick-up. I would gladly come back and stay with Maryellen's family again on my next visit to NY.  "
1114,5203,897488,2/2/12,1544337,Teresa,The host canceled my reservation 92 days before arrival.
1115,5203,902215,2/5/12,1542894,Alina,"I absolutely loved staying with the Lehmanns! They were helpful, friendly and just overall fantastic people. I loved feeling like I was part of a family during my first ever trip to NYC - and especially loved all the tips they gave me about New York through the eyes of true native New Yorkers. The apartement was fantastic! Very clean and spacious. Also, as many before me mentioned - the homemade granola was incredible :) I'm happy to say that I not only had a successful first airbnb trip to New York, but also made friends with the Lehmanns while I was there. I'll see you again soon! :)"
1116,5203,910557,2/9/12,176018,Dorothy,A wonderful place to stay!  The home-made granola is the best!

1118,5203,1443049,6/9/12,2287472,Sue,"A perfect airbnb experience! MaryEllen and her family are kind, sweet, and friendly. The room is perfect, fairly quiet, and a small step across the hall to the bathroom which, despite four kids in the house, was available every time I had need.The neighborhood is fun and interesting (with a hidden easter egg for Seinfeld fans. !! Don't miss it, around 113th and Broadway). The subway is a couple of short blocks away, so getting anywhere from there is quick and easy.I'm looking forward to staying here again."
1119,5203,1474661,6/13/12,2379285,Christopher,"MarryEllen and Mike have a wonderful family.  They opened up their home and staying there is like having a team of hosts in a warm atmosphere.  The children are hospitable, attentive and smart!  If something is needed there is always someone around to help, yet their home has the ambience of everyone quietly carrying on their business. The location is convenient for walking and public transportation and there is a wonderful fresh and healthy market just two blocks away."
1120,5203,1515907,6/19/12,230210,Gaela,"I had a wonderful stay at Mary Ellenâ€™s place. The family is nice, I felt welcomed and the apartment is well located in New York if you want to visit any place in Manhattan."

1122,5203,1630450,7/4/12,2596182,Anouk,"I had a great time staying with the Lehmann family! Even though I was out in the city most of the time it was nice to have a chat in the morning (lovely home made granola by the way!). Excellent bed in a safe family apartment, close to subway and in a convenient location (very nice part of Manhattan, though less busy than crowded midtown for example). Would warmly recommend staying here."
1123,5203,1667995,7/9/12,1325946,Christina,I really liked staying with MaryEllen and her very nice family. They were helpful and friendly but easy-going. The apartment is neat and clean and I felt very save in the neighborhood. Any location in Manhatten can be reached easily. There were a fan and air-condition in the room and the bed was indeed very comfortable. I would definitely come back!
1124,5203,1691751,7/12/12,2384884,Shaina,"Mary Ellen is a godsend.  I got food poisoning during my stay, and she took wonderful care of me.  I can't get over what a kind hostess she is.  Believe it or not, I couldn't have been any more comfortable in my own house.  Thank you Mary Ellen!  I hope next time my stay is far less eventful for you!"
1125,5203,2557612,10/9/12,3202418,Natasha,"I had the most wonderful time staying with the Lehman family. The room was cosy, the kids were great, and the apartment was easy to get to. I loved where I was staying in NYC and it was made possible by Mary Ellen. I was traveling on my ow be the girls Rachel and Sarah Grace were happy to converse with me whenever I was in the house. I really loved my stay in New York and I was made to feel kind of like part of the family and kind of like a New Yorker too. 10/10 would definitely stay there again!"
1126,5203,2637919,10/16/12,3721864,Jie,"This was my first airbnb experience. Had a 2 nights stay and it was great! Everything's as per advertised. It was an easy, comfortable experience. I was travelling alone, so safety was the most important consideration I had. I had no problems returning to the apartment alone at night around 10+pm via subway. The subway exit was next to a 24 hours grocery store, so even at night, there are people walking around and the path was brightly lighted. The building entrance has a nice, helpful doorman in the evenings and was brightly lighted, with working elevator. The room was private and cosy. Empty apartments just feel haunted to me.. so I really liked that the apartment has a lived-in family ambience (but not noisy, I could do work on my laptop in the room without any disturbance). Rachel (one of the daughters), MaryEllen and Mike were really nice, friendly and helpful, the rest of the children were cheerful and friendly too. Rachel and Mike were very good with directions, even providing detailed instructions with hand-drawn maps! Room and bathroom were clean and neat. If you choose to stay at MaryEllen's place, I'll suggest to take supershuttle service for airport transfers - from JFK was about USD 25 and to LGA was about USD 20."
1127,5203,2822653,11/7/12,3109628,Anna,"I had a great stay and Mary Ellen and her family were lovely - especially after I had to make some changes due to storm Sandy, everything worked out well in the end :)"
1128,5203,2891736,11/15/12,79276,Yumiko,"I have just stayed her place while 5 days. I actually had been living in this aria while long before moved to back to Japan. That is why This aria was perfect for me. It is very safe and convenience like just 20 minutes to get to Times Square. There are many good places to eat. Also, there some nice night places like Jazz live house or fancy bars. The room was very comfy. And it was completely private room. I enjoyed stayed her place and the neighborhood. Due to Sandy hurricane happened in NYC, I actually had to changed so many times my schedule. She was very flexible and helpful for it. Thank you Marry Ellen! I am defiantly coming back to in future! I am strongly suggest her place for your vacation!!"
1129,5203,3031183,12/5/12,3971266,Catherine,"What a wonderful experience!  This family is terrific.  Being from a large family myself, having the parents and children around was a real treat.  In addition of having my own room, the kitchen was available for me to use and the bathroom was pretty much mine, too.  The true surprise was listening to the children play piano each evening - they are really good!  Next time I'm in New York, I will definitely hook up with Mary Ellen and her family."
1130,5203,3104542,12/17/12,4166070,Jessica,"NY was a little overwhelming at first and MaryEllen's apartment was exactly the place I needed to recoup. The room is cozy, the shower is hot and the neighborhood is safe. I was even able to score some delicious homemade raviolis on their pasta night! Couldn't have asked for a better host family. Thanks!"
1131,5203,3121169,12/19/12,593077,Tracy,"MaryEllen was a fantastic host!  She was so flexible with me, and even accepted  a date that she did not list as available because it worked for my schedule.  So helpful!  Also the apartment is in a great neighborhood, 2 blocks from the subway.  Very safe area and doorman in the evenings.   The room was exactly as described, the bed and linens were very comfortable.  While I didn't have too much interaction with all of the family, the interaction I did have, they were kind and helpful and so polite!  I would absolutely stay here again!"
1132,5203,3608641,2/22/13,2384884,Shaina,"I love staying here.  It's convenient, comfy, and I feel right at home.  The bed and sheets are perfect, the terry cloth robe is very cozy, and breakfast is delicious.  Mary Ellen and her family are wonderful!  Thanks for everything."
1133,5203,3885802,3/25/13,4519848,Melissa,"After deciding that I was going to relocate from New Zealand to New York, I was hit with the task of finding safe, clean, and affordable accommodation in an incredibly overpriced city.  Finding MaryEllen's apartment was the best thing I could have done - the location was great, less than a 1 minute walk to a major subway line, safe, well-lit, very clean area.  MaryEllen's building also has an elevator which is such a lifesaver after all those steps you take getting around the city!  MaryEllen and her family are also so generous with their time in assisting you with advice on how to get to the places you need to be.  This was my first AirBnB experience, and it couldn't have been better!"
1134,5203,4045281,4/5/13,1966311,Georgeta,"I enjoyed my stay. The room was as depicted in the picture. The bathroom was just across the room, no clutter, clean. Providing a fluffy white robe was  very thoughtful and added to the cozy feel. MarryEllen and her family were delightful, I only feel sorry I was so busy that I did not have more time to chitchat a lit bit more. Additionally, the location of the apartment is great, just off Broadway, close to subway and restaurants. Very safe. Perfect for anyone visiting NYC. Thanks MaryEllen. "
1135,5203,4146349,4/14/13,3997059,Brenda,"A perfect place for this solo traveler...great west side location, a comfy room, gracious accommodating hosts...and the background bustle of their lively family.  "
1136,5203,4431128,5/5/13,4211636,Karen,"This is perfect for someone who wants a homey, comfortable and personable place to stay. I was warmly welcomed by Mary Ellen when I arrived, and had opportunities for nice conversations with other family members during the course of my stay. I had plenty of privacy and could come and go on my own schedule - no pressure to socialize. The room was comfortable; the location is incredible: just two blocks from Central Park and between Amsterdam and Broadway, so it's close to plenty of restaurants, coffee shops and markets, as well as very close to public transportation lines. And where else could I hear piano music as I got ready for my day!"
1137,5203,4563417,5/13/13,5088903,Lisa,"I really enjoyed my stay at Mary-Ellen's.  In fact, I felt extremely 'at home' there.  She and her family were so welcoming and I had several fun chats with their eldest daughter who was also very helpful.  My early arrival was accommodated, I was free to come and go as I pleased and the home-made granola with fruit and yoghurt at breakfast was delish.  Mary-Ellen even gave me some to go home with, along with the recipe, which I just made for the first time back in Paris.  Thanks Mary-Ellen & co!  :-)  A bientÃ´t..."

Beautiful the Cathedral of St. John the Divine 5 blocks away...Also my favorite place is Colombia university is also close. The campus is beautiful. Great Mexican, Cuban, Hamburger, cafe places are just close to the apartment. Safe neighborhood and nice host and cozy room. Everything was parfect!! I really want to back to their place again!!

1143,5203,6051287,7/28/13,6809030,Margie,"Staying with MaryEllen and her family was fantastic! This was my first experience with Airbnb and I absolutely loved my time with them.  The room was clean and very inviting, the bed is honestly the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and even though another family came to stay in the other room during my stay, I never had to wait for the bathroom.  I felt totally comfortable coming and going as I pleased, and MaryEllen left croissants and Nutella for me for when I woke up since I like to sleep in on vacation. I loved hanging out with the family, and I got along well with all of the children-- such a sweet family! The shower was nice and tall, which was great for someone who is 6'4"" (the twin bed was a little short for me but that was my only complaint-- the footboard was low enough for me to put my feet over). The oldest daughter was very helpful when I arrived and drew me a map of the area and gave me recommendations for places to eat, and the whole family was very willing to answer the questions I had, and since I was fighting allergies, they let me have their Throat Coat tea with extra honey :) I would absolutely stay here again, any time! "
1144,5203,9578332,1/2/14,10895107,Jen,"I stayed here for New Years Eve and it was a much better alternative to spending $$ in a hotel! The subway was only a couple blocks away and I felt very safe walking to and from the subway. The entire family was very nice and welcoming! Mary and her oldest daughter were very helpful. Her oldest daughter took me to and showed me how to navigate the metro, gave some ideas on what to do on NYE and how to get there, and put out breakfast in the morning. The house was clean and quiet, and Mary had made soup so it smelt delicious as soon as I walked in! I felt like I had a lot of privacy and slept well on the bed - and I'm a pretty picky sleeper. I would definitely stay there again!"

It was a perfect match! I felt very home, relaxed and welcomed. I stayed in smaller room but honestly-it was totally enough space for my needs. Super comfortable bed, fan was chilling room perfectly or hot May nights (there is even optional AC if its too hot), I had closet and shelves for all my stuff, small table. Shower might  shared with another guest if someone is staying in bigger room, but it's clean and nice.Very kind family members did leave granola breakfast and coffee every morning. They were so generous to help with advice, some medicine for my non-wellness and even made a lil card at breakfast table at my (Website hidden by Airbnb) the same time I never felt bothered and had as much privacy, rest and comfort as I needed.Subway is literally 3 min walk; it's 15 min to midtown and 30min to downtown-it's amazingly convenient, there is no way you will be late or confused! In the area there are multiple groceries stores, places to eat. It also safe. When I move to NYC next year I will be looking for a place in same neighborhood. I will def recommend this place to all my friends-visitors of NYC. Thank you dear family!!!"

The apartment is located in a nice area on the upper west side, just a few mintues walk from the metro or less than $20  cab ride from Time Square. She left a light breakfast in the kitchen for me in the morning. The bathroom is shared with the other guests, if any, otherwise it is all yours.  I will definitely recommend her for your visit to NYC. Lovely stay in a truly lovely american family."

I will add that the neighborhood is very convenient and close to everything I needed (bank, buses, subway, Rite Aid, Starbucks, etc.). It is also very close to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and to the coffee shop featured on Seinfeld. I would stay here again for sure. I had no troubles whatsoever and I was very comfortable. I will miss Mary Ellen's homemade granola! Thank you, Lehman family!"
1150,5203,14830937,6/27/14,7575663,Laura,"My stay in NYC wars certainly improved because I stayed with MaryEllen and her family. When I arrived Mary Ellen greeted me outside here door and made me feel very welcome. The room and bathroom were neat and clean, the mattress was just right. The air conditioner kept the room very comfortable and provided a noise screen too. Great neighborhood! I felt very comfortable walking by myself at night. I will definitely contact Mary Ellen for lodging my next time in NYC."

MaryEllen and her family were very welcoming - she provided homemade granola for breakfast and even made me decaf coffee when I requested it. The bed was comfortable and the room was nice and quiet, the bathroom was very nice. The only downside is that the wifi didn't always reach to the back rooms which made it hard to facetime my family at home. Great stay over all though."

1164,5203,23992141,12/16/14,1308471,Sissi,"Wonderful stay, I had homemade granola and croissants each breakfasts and French toast my last morning! I ended in a bigger room than expected, which was very nice and my own bathroom. Warm hospitality but still having my privacy. I totally recommend staying with Mary Ellen and family! "

1166,5203,124328766,1/1/17,102874431,Natasha,MaryEllen is an amazing host. My friend and I stayed at her place for NYE. She made it feel like home. Thank you MaryEllen for all your help :) will def be staying at your place if I ever visit NYC again.  
1167,5203,125035413,1/3/17,55275869,Sarah Anne,"I am so very grateful to have found such a cozy place to stay on my first solo trip to the big apple. Their home is almost as lovely as them! Tea, delicious sticky buns, and the coziest bed made for a fantastic stay. My only regret is not being able to stay longer! "
1168,5203,126386267,1/11/17,12656378,Luis Guillermo,"Maryellen was a wonderful host, she went above and beyond to make my stay absolutely amazing. She responded to all my text messages. The place is very close to Mount Sinai St' Lukes if you are going to interview there. I would definitely stay again. "

1171,5203,132851581,2/19/17,500371,Mafaz,"Mary-Ellen and her family were wonderful hosts and their apartment is absolutely charming. I stayed for three nights and immediately felt as though I had been there before because of how comfortable the place was. It was lovely to wake up to the smell of toasted croissants and coffee every morning. Mary-Ellen showed me where everything was as soon as I arrived and was extremely accommodating to my check-in and check-out times. The location is close to several subway stations and not too far from Central and Riverside Parks. There are a bunch of great coffee shops around the neighborhood as well. If you're looking for a clean, comfortable, and welcoming environment then this is definitely the place to book!"
1172,5203,136239011,3/9/17,29543919,Asami,MaryEllen's place felt like home and was always full of delicious smells. The room is simple with a small bed and desk space that is part of a large book shelf but roomier than I expected. I was visiting Columbia so the location was perfect. Very close to restaurants and the 110th St station to catch the 1 train. I didn't get to spend much time with MaryEllen or her teenage kids but I had a lovely time chatting with her husband and hanging out with their dog during breakfast. Definitely recommended for solo travelers.
1173,5203,136563917,3/11/17,11040763,Ashton,"The whole family is amazing, including their sweet dog.I will suggest staying with them to anyone I know who plans a trip to NYC."

Mary Ellen is easy to communicate with, and provides a very pretty, comfy room that's in quite a nice building. I got there late and left early, but the nice desk in the room helped me get some essays written for my classes. Definitely hope to stay here again for future city visits!"

What a fantastic experience this was all round. MaryEllen and her family (incluindo Fred, the dog), were fantastic, charismatic and super receptive. They give you your space (I had my own bathroom), and really make you feel at home.  I am asthmatic and didn't have to touch my inhaler once, which is a huge deal for me. MaryEllen and her family were an absolute pleasure. They really were, and words really can't capture accurately how pleased I am with the experience. Thanks M.E and familyTiago"
1180,5203,151578236,5/13/17,109690458,Barbara,"I stayed one week at MaryEllen's home. She and her husband were really flexible of checking in and out. During my stay I could come and go like I want because of my own key. As I was on the way all the time, we didn't see us so often, but nevertheless we had some nice talks. Otherwise the family accepts my private sphere, so I felt really well at their home. Also the family-dog Freddy is so lovely and good-natured. Coffee, tee, granola and fruits were available all the time. MaryEllen also made towels and a hairdryer available for me. Their nice, big flat is well-located at a subway-station and you can reach Times Square in about 20 min. The Central park is in walking distance. I felt safe at their home and in the surrounding area all time. So I can really recommend MaryEllen's home specially for single travellers, because I think you could rely on their help in case of need."

1182,5203,170492373,7/15/17,130906520,Abdul,If you are a lone traveller and need a place to sleep and drop bags safely then look no further. This place is on broadway and at walking distance to subway and central park. That's all you need to discover the top attractions of Manhattan. Mary and her husband Mike are very hospitable. They made sure that guy at reception is aware of my arrival to treat me well. They welcomed me right at the elevator's door and helped me with my heavy luggage. They even kept their dog locked so that it doesn't interfere with guest. There were few things which required their assistance like shower operation. On checkout the humble Mike again helped me with the luggage and saw me off until I boarded the cab. Thanks Mike n Marry for making me feel at home.
1183,5203,172700991,7/21/17,31191229,Jeong-A,I enjoyed Mary's flat a lot not only because of her hospitality but also because of all the family members' care. I would like to recommend this lovely stay for dog lovers and ones who wanna stay near the park and calm neighborhood with convenient public transportation. I would love to come and stay this place again for my next stay :)
1184,5216,1701,4/21/09,10901,Luis,"I highly recomend this apartment!... Just arrived home now from NY and had a blast there. The apartment has the best location one can get. Just in the midle of everything. It's very confortable, quiet and cozy.I'll be back for sure!"

Her superintendent wasn't to friendly thou. So if u need a central place that will give you a good nigjt sleep , her place is that place to be. "
1187,5216,6137,7/26/09,22211,Sergio,"Great place to rest and keep your belongings safe and secure. Tonya and her family are really friendly and very responsive. We had some trouble with her internet connection, but it didn't matter since there were plenty of free wi-fi cafes all around us. The superintendent did seem a bit up tight. However, I highly recommend this apartment!!!"
1188,5216,7618,8/17/09,25777,Nick,"The apartment was in a great area, and was super large as advertised. I had no problems with Tony or the super. I definitely recommend the place."

She was very courteous, responsive, and flexibile (me and my travel partner were late due to traffic, and she arranged for the property manager to meet us, even though it was 9pm).  My friend and I enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend this property and Tonya as a hostess anyday!  Thanks again Tonya!"

1193,5216,18436,11/27/09,51224,Paula,Our stay was disappointing as we did not stay in the apt advertised.  Accomodations did not reflect the images posted on the site. No explanation was given as to why we were given an apt on the 2nd floor instead of the one on the fourth floor as per the itineary. Found the space to be somewhat dangerous (non child proof)with an open loft that had no railing as was seen in the pictures. My child was disappointed to have not been able to sleep upstairs for fear of rolling down to the first level.  Th bathroom was cramped with very little space to move around and an exposed hot pipe that ran from floor to ceiling that burnt my child when she went to take a shower.  Not an ideal place to stay with kid(s).  The street view does not represent the actual street (W 25th) where the apt was located.
1194,5216,196728,3/11/11,293312,Chris,"Nice apartment for two people to stay in NYC, maybe a little small for two couples. The lofted bedroom is quite short, but overall an extremely convenient apartment and convenient stay (super lives in the building so key hand-off, etc was easy)."
1195,5216,261267,5/12/11,2425,Crisel,"Our stay at Super Large APT was amazing! We booked the room one day in advance of our stay which can be a little nerve wrecking, but Tonya was great at responding. The check in was very easy and upon enterting the apt I found it to be quite charming - perfect for two people. There's a balcony which we didnt really use, but a 'nice to have' in case you want to chill in between sightseeing! The bed was comfy and I loved the decor. There were extra sheets/towels and even a hair dryer which was great since I forgot mine! The couch was also very comfy - again, perfect for two people. The location itself was great - easy access to diff neighborhoods. At the end of each day I was very happy to head back and would def stay here again. I didnt get to meet Tonya personally, but she sounds great and was an accomodating host! The checkout was also super easy. If you're looking for a nice place to call home away from home, stay here!"

1202,5216,2210610,9/5/12,3234406,Jared,"We were very pleased with our stay at Tonyas. The location of this place is perfect, restaurants, shopping, pubs, clubs, time square, subway access, everything we wanted to experience when going to NYC, all so close. It's a cozy place that will comfortably sleep three people, more if you double up in beds. The only issue we had was with the wireless Internet, which did not work. This was a nuisance as we are from out of the country and use our Internet for much of the day planning, therefore or phone bills became very expensive."
1203,5216,2798777,11/4/12,2642940,Melanie,"We stayed at NYC during the hurrican Sandy. Tonya gave us all the assistance we needed.The apartment was perfect and very clean. "
1204,5216,3330877,1/12/13,3296714,Amanda,"My friends and I stayed in Tonya's apartment for 13 nights and had an amazing time in NYC!! This apartment was quite small but is good in accommodating up to three people. It also didn't appear to be very clean but just some maintenance here and there would really refresh its look and appeal. Tonya was a fantastic host who answered any of my concerns or questions very quickly and was very helpful during our entire stay. The LOCATION of this apartment was phenomenal - 10 mins walking distance to Times Square, subway around the corner and central to many key NYC spots. Towards the end of our time in NY the apartment really did start to feel like home and we all would come back and rent from Tonya again! "
1205,5216,3685115,3/4/13,4202682,Meredith,"This apartment was in a great area of NYC! Don't let the street front deceive you.  Things were clean and was a good size.  It's definitely darker than the pictures and I wouldn't recommend more than 4 people since the fold out futon is not very comfortable.  Tonya did reply right away to an email when we couldn't find more toilet paper and couldn't get the sofa to fold down which was great.  Great location, and good space. "
1206,5216,3814965,3/18/13,421346,Christopher,"A great apartment in a great spot- my friends and I had a great time in NYC, and big thanks to Tanya for her great place!"
1207,5216,4073266,4/8/13,3231709,Vanessa,Situated in a great location.  The apartment was definitely not spacious even though the pics make it look spacious.  The beds were comfortable.  The loft bed is smaller.  4 persons stayed.  The plumbing in the shower/bath is very slow to drain and was full of hair.  There is a plunger and a strainer there but it definitely needs attention.  The keys were available as advised.  The price was very reasonable.  You don't get the street noise which is good.
1208,5216,4562493,5/13/13,4973391,Annia,"Situated in a great location, near subways, restaurants and make it easy to enjoy the whole city. The apt is less spacious than the pics let think, but still good value for money. A little bit dark as the window shows the back of the building, but the plus is thus that the place is really quiet for a very central NY street. Definitely for not more than 4 people, (so maybe ""Super Large"" is not exact) but enough to spend the nights. We did not met Tonya but Winston, the superintendant, was of great help. Enjoy your stay !"

Easy checkin and checkout, comfortable accommodations and great location close to subway and restaurants on 26th St, plus groceries and CVS. Very walkable to Little Italy, NYU, and lots of shopping on 5th Avenue. I really appreciated being able to book on short notice. Way better than a hotel. "

The gentlemen who work in the building are professional and made us feel safe.  The apartment had everything we needed and was clean when we arrived.  The location was amazing, easy walk to multiple trains.  Everything from booking throughout the stay was professional and very easy to work with.  Owner contacted us several times throughout stay to check in. Every time we saw the gentlemen who worked here they always asked if we were ok and if we needed anything.   Great place, great people.  Highly recommend it."
1214,5216,107820726,10/12/16,28473682,Neal,"The location is the major selling point here.  Seconds from the Flatiron building, meaning you're right in the Manhattan action.If you aren't super fussy about the ""design"" aspect of the space, then this is your best option.  Ultimately, you're in New York.. no one spends time in their apartment and neither will you."

El barrio estÃ¡ bien y la localizaciÃ_n muy buena. Buena comunicaciÃ_n con todo Manhattan pues hay varias paradas de metro cerca.

1216,5216,129546765,1/31/17,33209988,Gaby,Tonya Thank you for hosting us!  it was great.
1217,5216,271200449,5/31/18,77814223,Robert,"Tonyaâ€™s place is truly a home away from home. Itâ€™s in a great place in the city for first time visitors since itâ€™s smack dab in the middle of Manhattan!  Itâ€™s relatively close to the subways and blocks away from some really great attractions and restaurants.  Tonya is very easy to talk to, and because she lives so close, she is always there to lend a hand or give some useful advice in a time of need. She and Winston were very helpful to us during our stay on more than one occasion.  My only small complaint is that the WiFi and signal in the apartment was a bit spotty at times which made working from home a bit of a hassle. You gotta find that sweet spot where you can connect your devices and get decent signal â€” aka just move closer to the window till you hit it!  Honestly though, that is such a small thing compared to what the apartment offers. I always felt secure coming home and I knew that my room and my things were always safe. For the location and the amenities (I.e. full kitchen, fire stick TV, two beds, plenty of storage, etc.) you canâ€™t beat the price. I would definitely come stay here again and recommend it to any of my friends staying in the city."
1218,5238,8739,9/1/09,14340,Sarah Jane,Ben was so hospitable and his apartment is very comfortable and tastefully decorated. The location is fantastic (right next to the subway) I would DEFINITELY stay there again. Highly recommended.

1224,5238,76361,8/9/10,172393,Andrew,"We had a great time at Ben's apartment.  When we arrived from the airport he was already waiting with the keys.  After about 2 min of explaining everything, we were on our own.  The apartment was perfect for the two of us, but could easily fit 4.  It's in a good location and had everything we needed.  I had a great experience and highly recommend the apartment and renting from Ben."
1225,5238,93065,9/8/10,151696,Tessa,"My fiance and I stayed at Ben's place over Labor Day weekend and had a pleasant experience.  The location was good, very close to the subway, and the apartment was clean.  However, there were a couple things that we were not so happy with.  1)  The bed.  For one person, the bed may work, but for a couple the bed is not good at all because there is a giant hole in the middle of it that you kind of sink into.  2)  The air conditioner.  The air conditioner wouldn't work and we couldn't figure out for the life of us why, until my fiance decided to open it up and found 2 inches of dust in the filter which we proceeded to clean.  The place cooled down nice after that but cleaning up other people's air conditioners wasn't what we wanted to be doing.  3)  The pictures are misleading.  It looks the same, but the pictures make the apartment look a lot bigger than it is in reality.  Hope this helps!  "
1226,5238,145447,11/28/10,212999,Ruediger,"I stayed a week at Ben's apartment. He left the apartment a short time after my arrival. He is a nice, friendly and very helpful guy, for example he gave me very exact and detailed hints, how to get to his apartment even before I arrived. He explained me the essential things in his apartment like the heater, which window could be opened best etc. After a few days, he contacted me by mail and asked, if I needed some help or recommendations. The apartment is clean, homely with enough space for one or two people. It has no exaggerated style but a charming atmosphere. The subway F-Line is right around the corner. The neighborhood is young, ethnically mixed, with many small shops. The supermarket, where you can buy with Ben's discount card, is only some minutes away. All in all worth a visit to Ben's apartment. I highly recommend Ben with his hospitality and his apartment.Thank you, Ben!! "
1227,5238,176198,1/30/11,345338,Lily,"Ben was an incredible host, I really couldn't have asked for a more fantastic experience. His home - it really does feel like a home away from home - is perfectly tidy and clean, and bears lovely personal touches. For example, Ben added a quaint quilt to the bedding (it was freeeeeezing cold the week I was there) which he told me belonged to his grandfather. Example #2: the fridge was stocked with beers leftover from NYE which he said I was welcome to help myself to. So nice!The apartment has good heating, TV, a coffee maker (and coffee & filters), and a really comfy bed. It's SO close to the East Broadway subway, which was really convenient. Actually, I found the location perfect, it was really easy to get across to Williamsburg and uptown.

From before we arrived to let us know you are worried about the price, time and means of transport to get from JFK airport to his home. It has always been helpful in giving us directions and advice on NY in general. The house is as you see in the picture, very comfortable. Also it is quiet and there are a very comfortable bed and a sofa. The location was great and convenient for visiting the city. The metro is 30 meters. The alternative is of course to walk and see the city street by street and area to area. We preferred this possibility, starting from home and going straight through Chinatown, Little Italy, Nolita, Washington Square, West Village and on to Central Park. It's a great walk. In short, a guest house and perfect. Recommended to anyone who wants to take a vacation to NY."
1290,5238,11634593,4/10/14,148284,Jeremy,"Ben was a great host. He accommodated our check-in and check-out times, gave us lots of great information, made a bit of space for us in his closet, and was easily accessible for questions. The apartment was cozy with the typical NYC quirks, and the subway is a block away. The apartments is located on the edges of several neighborhoods, chinatown being dominant. Would recommend. "
1291,5238,12044817,4/22/14,8798703,Steffen,"We stayed at Ben's place for a week around Easter. The appartment is quite small, but it fitted our needs very well and we had a good time. It lays in a nice neighbourhood, not much noise and close to both a subway station and some delis. We didn't spend that much time in the appartment, we were mostly in the city, so we didn't have the chance to use the kitchen very much - there wouldn't be any problem with using the kitchen though; it contains both a stove and a quite big oven. There might be a problem with eating homemade food, because the appartment doesn't have a dining table, but it shouldn't be a problem in a city like NYC, where there's delicious and cheap food practically just around the corner. We only ate breakfast at the appartment, and we used, quite creatively, some stools as little individual tables. We didn't have any problems with hot water - there were always enough for us three girls.Ben was an incredible host. He answered all our emails very quickly, and he gave us good guidance to both the neighbourhood and appartment, the city, and the transportation to and from the airport. His help and advice had a huge part of making our trip amazing. We can only recommend his appartment!"

Even though it is a relatively small apartment, it was no problem fitting in 3 persons. As we spend most of our day in the city, we didn't really needed more space. The place was nice and clean, and had everything we needed. The location is perfect. Brooklyn Bridge, Chinatown and Financial District is in walking distance, and if youÂ´re going uptown, there is a subway station 2 minutes walk from the apartment.Ben is a great host. From our very first contact he was informative and thorough. When we arrived he walk us through how everything worked, and during our stay he contacted me, making sure that we had everything we needed.I would highly recommend this place!  "
1295,5238,13503142,5/29/14,11365118,James,"Ben was so relaxed and helpful.  The apartment is great for a city trip and so close to the Subway you couldn't get any closer?!  You can be anywhere in minutes which is so helpful.  It's a nice and quiet as well which is helpful when you need to get your head down (there is a launderette underneath so sometimes you hear the washing/dryer machines but they're super helpful there too and turned round some washing for me in no time at all so always a plus!)"

The apartment was very clean, the bed was comfortable (mattress is new), plenty of towels and everything (TV, kitchen essentials etc) that I needed was available in the apartment.  The apartment was quiet and conventiently located on the second floor of the building.  The subway station is a half block/street away from the apartment.  The neighborhood is safe, lively and filled with restaurants, bars and cafes, a great neighborhood.I highly recommend future guests of Airbnb booking/staying at Ben's apartment.  Thank you Ben for making my stay in NY most enjoyable and hassle free.Best regards,Dolph Orlando     "

He was helpful with logistics and coordinating the visit - especially since our trip was a last minute booking with a late check-in hour. Great area and super close to the subway.

It was spacious by New York standards, clean and very conveniently located near a subway.Ben was very friendly and helpful himself. During our stay, there was a problem with the drain in the bathtub. He did all he could to fix it without imposing on our stay.Stay here if you are looking to have an authentic NYC living experience in the Lower East Side!"

1303,5238,20413531,9/29/14,5962281,Grace,"Ben's place in the lower eastside was a great location for our needs.  We came into town for a wedding and Ben was able to host us at his cute apartment.  The apt is very close to all major transportation options including a metro stop, several bus lines, and taxis.  In addition to that,  we were able to locate many local places to eat in Chinatown and Little Italy! The apartment itself is a perfect space for 1-2 people with a cozy living room (cable included!), a surprisingly spaciously bedroom, and full bath. It is decorated with fun glimpses of his interests and film history.  The neighborhood felt very safe, we walked around at night and during the day and the people in the area are great, working class folks.  It was clean and ready for us to use when we arrived.  Whenever I contacted Ben, he was very responsive with helpful tips.  He was prompt to be there at our agreed check in and check out time.  We have to give Ben a very special thank you, mistakenly on our part, left the spare keys in our pockets and in the whirlwind of trying to get to the airport did not give them back! He was very gracious and understanding despite the circumstance, and we were able to FedEx it back to him overnight.  In short, Ben is a great host and a laid back guy! His prices can't be beat for Manhattan and its proximity to Brooklyn and all the surrounding areas.  "

We appreciated the email giving public transport directions for us from JFK airport. When we met Ben, he was friendly, helpful and ran through the useful information to know about the flat. The flat is really close to a subway stop so great for getting around. We loved that it was only one stop to Brooklyn and would recommend going over early evening to watch the lights of Manhattan turn on as dusk arrives.  The flat was comfortable for us (2 people) and it had a good strong shower to wake us up! The area was fine, no issues at all. There were always lots of people around so it felt safe.  There are lots of places to eat nearby. "

Justo abajo del departamento hay una lavanderÃ_a que nos fue muy Ãºtil! y en la esquina hay mini markets que estÃ¡n abiertos hasta muy tarde y todo lo que necesitamos lo compramos ahÃ_ a la hora que fuera, muy cÃ_modo. Algo muy importante!, podÃ_amos descansar perfectamente del ruido de la ciudad porque en la noche casi no hay ruido, a excepciÃ_n de un dÃ_a que al parecer algÃºn vecino hizo una fiesta pero nada grave. Por otra parte decir que Ben definitivamente da mucha confianza como persona y eso se agradece mucho."
1308,5238,23520742,12/3/14,18031684,Emily,I had a great first Airbnb experience at Ben's in the lower east side. We were met at the apartment by our host (even though we got in super late) and got lots of info and tips about getting around and the local area. The apartment was well equipped and very close to the nearest subway station. Overall I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a place to stay in Manhattan.

The apartment was the perfect size for two people and everything we needed was there.Key exchange was also easy, though we probably put Ben out a bit when we didn't return the key properly (sorry Ben!).I would recommend the apartment to anyone. The LES is fun and vibrant and Ben's apartment was everything we needed for our time in NYC."

Before our trip, he was sure to find out which way we intended on travelling from the airport and gave us detailed yet simple to follow directions to his apartment. Upon our arrival, he made us feel very welcome, giving us all the information we needed about his place and was friendly and accommodating. The place itself is just as pictured/described. It was clean, tidy and incredibly well presented. It was the perfect amount of space for 2 people for a short-ish stay. The bed was really comfortable and the apartment was so quiet - despite being right next to chinatown - so we slept really well! The neighbourhood was great to stay in, full of places to eat and drink and a great location for transport - just seconds away from a subway station but also easy walking distance to many attractions. Ben was really great with our departure, in no way rushing us out and allowing us to leave our bags until the evening as we had a late flight. We'd absolute recommend Ben as a great host and would love to stay again!"

1317,5238,30668170,4/26/15,26677533,Nuria,"We stayed in Bens aparment 6 nights. The best of this apartment is its location, as you have East Broadway metro station not even one minute  walking, or you can walk quite easily wherever you go. the neighbourhood is not really nice but we did not encounter major issues. The apartment is small but for 1-2 persons is really fine. The blankets and towels were clean and the bed was comfortable. The shower was not working properly as the water stuck there, which is not really comfy when showering.The apartment looks quite old but in case you are looking to stay for a short period, Bens apartment is ok."

Since he was not in town during our stay he made sure we had all the information we needed in advance. Communication was also very easy, as he responded to our e-mails almost immediately when an issue came up. He provided us with detailed directions to his place and with his apartment being just a few footsteps away from the next subway station, it was not hard to find at all.The apartment itself was simple but cosy.  Everything we needed was provided. Our bedroom was not facing the street but a courtyard so it was mostly quiet (except during our first night when lots of helicopter traffic was going on).I can definetely recommend BenÂ´s place. It's not super fancy but if you're looking for something comfy and perfectly located  this is the place to go for. Great spot to explore NYC from.Thank you Ben!"

We were late getting in (almost two hours) and Ben was patient and understanding. The only thing I'd say to others is that Ben's apartment is not super close to most of the main tourist attractions.  That worked out for us as I usually stay uptown and wanted to get to know a different area.  There is a lot to do near his place (I especially recommend the tenement museum) but you've got to work a little harder at finding those points of interest. I'd happily stay at Ben's place again."

It was comfortable for three people despite being fairly small, and is well decorated and has all the amenities you'd expect.

1328,5238,41736392,8/9/15,7470545,Kris,"Just back from our short stay in NYC at Ben's apartment, which was more than fine for 2 nights. We appreciated Ben's flexibility with the arrival and departure times and he takes care to make sure you have all the information you need for the apartment and the nearby area. The place is small but that's typical for NYC apartments. The three of us did just fine - even had the choice of sleeping on the really long sofa in the bedroom or a ""real"" bed in the living room. We opted for the sofa and it was comfortable. Being so close to the East Broadway subway was a huge plus - it's literally steps away - and we were able to find a cab to get to airport without going too far. The shop owners in the near vicinity were nice - it was convenient being able to grab a deli sandwich late at night. Ben does a good job describing the area, which is what it is - as long as you don't come expecting the ambiance of Greenwich village or the Upper East Side, you'll be fine.  In the end, my friends appreciated seeing a ""real"" part of the City and we felt perfectly safe. Ben was good at communicating through the whole reservation process and gave us a nice welcome when we arrived. Thanks for a great stay!"

We had a number of contacts in case of emergency; however, we did not need to bother his friends as everything ran smoothly. Ben is an extremely interesting individual, and we wished we could have gotten to know him better - maybe next time.The place itself is well located to downtown, China Town, Little Italy, Soho and Brooklyn.  Even though we enjoyed walking around, the F Subway is on the corner - so no part of the city is too far.  The neighbourhood itself has a real community feel to it.  It has a mixed ethnic make-up, which gives it an interesting feel.  All in all, a quite enjoyable experience.  "

The perfect place if you're looking for something in the Lower East Side that comfortably houses two, is reasonably priced and isn't a hotel.As my wife put it, ""I want to stay in an apt and not a hotel to experience the Manhattan way of life"". This apt is perfect for that. While it has a kitchen and a dining table ideal for two, my wife and I spent most of our time seeing the sights and eating out.Ben was awesome. He was always available to answer questions via the AirBnB app and was very courteous, with a light sense of humor. His background in theater is apparent in the apt, with theater and movie-related decorations that were great conversation pieces. Won't hesitate to look this apt up again on our next visit to NY!"

He was very kind and accommodating and responsive to my many questions about restaurants and the area in general. He has amazing suggestions so take note! The area is interesting and rich with history. The apartment was clean and cozy. It is easily accessible to anywhere you want to go. Next time we are in NYC we will stay at Ben's.

The apartment is very funky and Ben clearly takes a lot of pride in making it look and feel unique and comfortable. Location in the lower east side near East Broadway subway and walking distance to downtown was ideal for us, as was the nearby laundromat and deli. Overall we had a fantastic experience staying with Ben and would highly recommend his apartment to anyone visiting NYC!"

The apartment was right next to the subway and in walking distance of cozy restaurant and bar areas. Ben was not in town while we were staying, but Ben was very helpful and accomodating with arrival and departure details and arranged everything to suit our needs. We would recommend Bens place to other guests looking for at nice place to stay in New York."

We didn't actually make any use at all of the kitchen (so many great places to eat in NY), but it seemed like it had everything we could have needed.We didn't meet Ben, but, we spoke as soon as we got in and he made sure everything was okay and we had everything we needed. He knew we had friends staying not too far away and had advice on how best to get to their area. He was a great host, very patient with our late arrival, and made us feel very welcome in his home. "
1356,5238,124700824,1/2/17,27263873,BarnabÃ©,C'Ã©tait super ! TrÃ¨s trÃ¨s bon emplacement et Ben est un hÃ´te trÃ¨s gentil et trÃ¨s serviable.
1357,5238,142514554,4/8/17,105340862,Noelia,"Estuvimos con mi novio 15 dias alojados en el departamento de Ben. Es un espacio lindo y comodo(para dos personas) para descansar despues de un dia de mucho recorrer. La cocina y el baÃ±o se encuentran muy bien equipados. La ubicacion del departamento es excelente, a pocas cuadras del Distrito Financiero. Con una estacion del subte F en la esquina, con el cual se llega muy directamente al aeropuerto JFK. En cuanto al barrio, como dice Ben, puede parecer un poco desprolijo por su cercania con el Barrio Chino, pero es muy seguro. Los unicos incovenientes que tuvimos fueron con la tina, la cual se tapa y el agua caliente dura 15 minutos y tarda bastante tiempo en volverse a calentar.Cabe destacar que Ben se ofrecio a pasar a limpiar el departamento en el medio de la estadia y a destapar la tina, aliviando un poco el problema.Como conclusion final, el departamento esta bueno, volveria sin dudas y lo recomiendo ampliamente. Respecto a Ben, es muy amable y flexible con los horarios de check in y check out."
1358,5238,145860602,4/20/17,95318488,Daniel,"Es un departamento ideal para dos. En el barrio chino,  con un super en la esquina. El Dpto tiene todo en bue n estado y Ben es un anfitriÃ_n ideal. Excelente opciÃ_n "
1359,5238,204944734,10/20/17,42157744,William,"Great locations for public transit, The F train is few steps away, The 6 train is a nice walk thru China Town, the D train is on Delancy about a 5-minute walk and you are close to the highway if you cab frequently. The Spanish restaurant next door food is amazing, as well as amazing Mexican Vegan restaurant up canal street. Laundry Mat and a pharmacy is next door as well, everything you need is within walking distance.  Perfect for a couple, its cozy apt with a very small kitchen area so if you cook it can be challenging. If you want to live like a New Yorker and walk to Manhattan Bridge for photos or perhaps walk across Brooklyn Bridge or even walk to East Village or Soho this is a great location."
1360,5238,216913163,12/6/17,145294033,Julian,Ben was a great host and very friendly. The handover went smoothly and quickly. He answered my questions quickly and friendly. We will gladly come again.
1361,5238,218398832,12/12/17,66310731,Petra,"We stayed at Ben's flat for 5 days. His place is situated in a great location right next to the subway, which is helpful. The apartment was clean and nicely decorated. Good communication. A good size flat for a couple. A few drawbacks worth mentioning when paying around Â£800 for the stay: a) pictures are somewhat missleading-the flat is VERY dark, almost no natural light so not suitable for staying in during the day, b) shower does not drain properly (which seems to be quite a frequent problem judging by the reviews) and toilet kept on blocking (Ben was responsive to this though), c) no cable TV though it is advertised and the Netflix subscription ran out on the second day of our stay so had to swich to our own - not a big deal but probably shouldn't happen when paying quite a lot of money for the stay. Overall, it was an okay stay (we only really slept in the flat and the flat was clean) but next time we would book something cheaper in Brooklyn as it is only one stop away from this apartment."
1362,5238,226435423,1/10/18,131235148,Catherine,Benâ€™s place is great! Good location if you are wanting an authentic NYC experience. Location is right next to Subway so you can get up town conveniently. Ben is really friendly and had great communication. We would stay there again for sure.
1363,5238,235656129,2/17/18,81204,Ruby,"My husband, 2 kids and I came into town for Chinese New Year to see my extended family. The location of this place is amazing - right in the middle of China Town, East Broadway subway station is right downstairs, playground across the street, cafes and restaurants all within walking distance. The place is small but we had enough room for even the 4 of us! Ben was a great host - attentive and flexible. Definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in this area.. and we'll look to book this place again when we come back in future years!"

The renovations are top-notch. The place is just 1 bloc away from Columbia University, 3 blocks from Central Park, only 1 block away from Line 1, 2, 3 trains and 3 blocks from subway A, B, and C, and the neighbourhood is full of great places to eat, drink and shop. All this only 20 minutes from downtown... Great experience altogether!"
1368,5295,3429,6/1/09,15393,Sara,Lena was so helpful and communicative throughout the entire process. Our arrival and departure was incredibly smooth- she arranged for her doorman to have the keys right when we arrived. Her building is beautiful and we had no problems getting anywhere- the 2 metro stops got us everywhere we wanted to be. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay for my first trip to the city!
1369,5295,4532,6/25/09,17372,George,"We had a truly wonderful stay in Lena's apartment. She was a generous and gracious host.

1372,5295,10987,9/22/09,15728,Ray,"Lena's friendly warm welcome and willingness to advise made our stay most enjoyable. Her apartment is very comfortable and with every convenience within close proximity, it was a great location for our stay in New York. Close to Central and Riverside parks with great places to eat, and a choice of 2 subway lines plus buses close by made getting around Manhattan easy. We highly recommend Lena's. "
1373,5295,12873,10/9/09,28443,Nicole,"Lena's apartment was great and she was a great host. She answered any transportation, restaurant, grocery store questions that we had.

1374,5295,13407,10/12/09,44097,Joanna,Lena was a fantastic host - even though she was on vacation at the time we visited she made sure we felt at home and made arrangements for pick up and drop off of the key. The apartment is really nice and great value - great place to chill out and unwind after a hectic day downtown.

For a new visitor to NY, this is an excellent home base, with all the comforts of home.Lena was out of town during our visit, but through email, text messaging, phone calls, her notes and recommendations, etc., everything worked super smooth.  Very delightful person and looking forward to meeting her on our next visit.Would definitely stay there again, and would recommend to friends.Thanks, Lena!!"
1377,5295,55850,6/21/10,139515,Heather,"I and a friend stayed at Lena's one bedroom apt for 5 nights. The over all experience was good. The location was a very nice area for us. The door man abel was very helpful and nice, really made us feel comfortable and helped us with our stay. The subway is close and there is a store and great pub restaurant on the same block a step away. Although keep in mind, this is a personal apt, and here is no professional cleaning. We did our own cleaning and was respectful of her belongings that were in her apt. Overall Lena was very kind and her place was a Life Saver. Thanks again Lena:) ps. You have a wonderful collection of books and we felt very comfortable. I can see you have a great heart I really appreciate you opening up your home to us. Take care!"

The apartment is exactly as described and the host is very attentive to all details. Everything was clean and well organized. The only thing that could be a bit better is the bed mattress, but this is a small detail that won't prevent you from having a good experience. "
1386,5295,9482346,12/30/13,1721797,Jennifer,"The apt was just as pictured. Everything was clean and welcoming. Lena was very communicative: she gave accurate directions and, because she couldn't be there, she left an additional contact person in case I needed help. My mom and I needed a place to stay at the last minute around the holidays when things with friends fell through and Lena was very accommodating on short notice. I'm very familiar with NYC and this is a great neighbourhood (right around the corner from the outstanding ""Absolute Bagels"") and very close to public transit.This apt would be ideal for 1-2 people on their first trip to NYC or someone just looking to stay in the city for a while.

The place looked as it was specified in the information available on the web. Lena is a very nice girl and inspires a lot of confidence. On arrival at the apartment, she gave us important details about the site and some recommendations to better enjoy our visit. The department has everything a visitor needs, and above all is very tidy and clean. The doorman of the building is very friendly. The area is fairly quiet and very close to two subway stations, which is important to organize trips into the downtown area. We strongly recommend to anyone who wants to visit NY stay in the department of Lena. At least that's what I hope to do when you return to NY .. Thanks for everything .. You are fantastic Lena"

When we entered into her apartment, we found no surprise!  What you see on the website, it's truly what you will get.  She has a guitar, good microwave, and good speakers.  Although I play a guitar, i do not touch it. We personally do not leave any fingerprints on those equipment because we value her space.  It's also my promise to her that I will keep her apartment clean.  On the first day when we arrived, I asked my son not to touch anything of the shelf.   I also feel obliged to clean her kitchen and floor.  I think she appreciated it because she mentioned the kitchen was spotless (Website hidden by Airbnb) am happy to stay in her place and thank her for sharing her space.  We would definitely go back to her apartment when we visit New York.  Thanks Lena.   (also she responded my inquiries quickly, just like what other said)."

Perfect location  (Upper West side a block from Harlem), perfect size (comfy 1 bedroom with gorgeous tile bath and small but well appointed combined living room and kitchen), perfect host (clear and fast communication).

1412,5435,9327,9/7/09,27623,Carolyn,"Delightful apartment! We really loved our stay at ""Riverside Drive""! The apartment was perfect for our purposes and Carla was great (as was ""Junior"", one of the doormen). The neighborhood is very nice - safe and quiet. Lots of great food nearby. You have to try the Turkish restaurant on 100th and Broadway! "
1413,5435,9995,9/13/09,34061,Flo,"Very clever use of space and pleasing aesthetic.  Building staff was delightful.  Easy location, 2 blocks from the subway, not hard to park on the street.  A real upper west side apartment.  Particularly works if you plan to eat most meals out, as the kitchen is beautiful but minimal.  Would recommend."
1414,5435,11743,9/28/09,32352,Tara,Apt was quiet and everyone was very helpful. We found that Carla's space could have included room for her guests to unpack but all in all we had a good relaxing time while there.
1415,5435,13301,10/12/09,38527,Caroline,"Carla's apartment is stunning! The building is beautiful and the people at the front desk are so nice, friendly and helpful.  I would stay again anytime I return to New York City!  So much better than a hotel --I felt like I was 'home.'  Absolutely marvelous!"
1416,5435,13955,10/18/09,33693,Lenka,"Carla apt. is nice,location is quiet,safe and Carla prepared list with every info needed for visitors,so our friends from Europe were very satisfied .Thanks Carla"

1418,5435,15950,11/2/09,30631,L. Judy,"Carla's apartment is CLEAN, lovely and tastefully decorated.  The neighborhood is fantastic, nearby everything ""especially Starbucks.""  The lobby staff were friendly and helpful.  The area is quiet and safe ... had a 4y/o with us.  If your spouse is over 6 ft, his feet might hang off the bed a touch.  Nonetheless, we would have a repeat stay and definitely recommend to others.  I do agree that the kitchen is minimal space but it's NYC .... go out and eat great food.     "
1419,5435,17371,11/15/09,49897,Julie,"The apartment is in a great location, with convenient access to the subway and tons of restaurants nearby. Carla is a very friendly and helpful host, and we really enjoyed our stay!"
1420,5435,18592,11/29/09,33570,Julie,"Indeed a great location and indeed very convenient! The ambience in the small clean apartment is warm, the bed really comfie with a view out the window of the river. The very compact kitchen is just enough for most needs and done in such good style and taste. Carla was the perfect concierge in absentia, leaving us many very useful books and information on NYC and its many treasures. We left a few to add to her collection and suggest that future travelers might do likewise! Thank you Carla, and thank you airbandb!"
1421,5435,19282,12/6/09,45424,Christina,We had a great time at Carla's place. she left very useful information and shared some with us before we came. The location was very convenient and close to the subway. Carla and ehr place were great and highly recommended! Thanks to Carla our first trip to New York was a great one.
1422,5435,22388,1/2/10,45218,Michela,"My stay in house of Carla has been pleasant indeed. The building is very beautiful and the zone is well served and sure.In the proximities the subway, restaurants and supermarkets you can be found.The apartment is small but well organized and clean.  I recommend it!!!"
1423,5435,111515,10/4/10,187185,Jennifer,"Had a great time at Carla's place. She is an amazing host. She left a lot of information on NYC and she was always there if you needed her for anything. The place was very CLEAN. Her descripition of the place is nothing compared to the actual place. Once I got there, I felt at home, so much better than staying in any hotel. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet. And the doorman there were very nice. Overall my experience at Carla's place was excellent! Look foward to staying again for my future visits. Thank you Carla! "
1424,5435,752345,11/28/11,1424648,Joey,"This was my first experience with airbnb. I would definitely book again this apartment next time I come up to NYC. Although I never really got the chance to meet Carla personally, I just knew she was available for reach at any time for anything I needed. She was helpful and understanding when I needed to leave the bags there for several hours after check out. Everything was already taken care of from the moment I arrived to pick up the keys at the lobby of the building. The neighborhood is very nice, the building easy to find and subway is only 2 blocks away. Anything you need is close by. Everyone knows New York rooms are small, and for more than 2 people it could get a bit crowded, specially if you carry many suitcases (A lot of the space is occupied by artwork, books). That aside, the place is super cozy and its got all the amenities you need for a nice stay in the city. For the money, you can't beat this. I really enjoyed it, Thank you Carla!"
1425,5435,834182,1/3/12,327585,Ina,We had a restful holiday stay kept company by her two mellow cats.
1426,5435,933940,2/20/12,1681870,Barbara,We enjoyed the apartment - and Carla's two cats.  It was perfect to be used as the extra bedroom we needed the weekend our daughters came to visit. 
1427,5435,1112301,4/12/12,1797018,Joanne,"Carla's apartment is incredible !  I felt so at home surrounded by Carla's beautiful art and  interesting (Website hidden by Airbnb) pictures of the apartment do not reflect the beauty of the space. The view from the bedroom window  at night of the river and the twinkling lights is fantastic !  I recommend the apartment to anyone who wants to stay in a neighborhood filled with interesting people, restaurants and parks. Communication with Carla was excellent. Before my trip Carla provided information about the neighborhood that made planning  easy. She also has a collection of city maps and guides that offer so many ideas about all the things that NYC offers. Thank You so much Carla, I loved my stay in your little treasure !"
1428,5435,1136142,4/16/12,1792374,Cheryl,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay in Carla's apt.  The home is decorated in a tasteful and artful way, something I love!  It made our stay so cozy and pleasant.  The neighborhood is lovely and convenient, a beautiful park on one side and subway entrance and cafes on the other. Carla was accommodating and fun to meet.  We will definitely consider another stay!"
1429,5435,1861085,8/1/12,2739045,Suzanne,"Carla was a wonderful host and we enjoyed the apartment and building very much. The location was useful, has amenities nearby and is close to the subway so would recommend for other visitors! "
1430,5435,2159220,9/1/12,1711770,Jess,"Carla's place is an ideal Manhattan location, and the photos posted don't do it justice. It's beautifully, personally furnished and decorated, comfortable for a single person or a couple. The building staff are almost all very helpful and friendly, as are the neighbors. Finally, as a bonus, the location is quiet enough that you can sleep with the windows open, getting the breeze off the Hudson--a real plus in New York in summer and fall (though there's the air conditioning option, too). Carla's communications were all timely and her instructions easy to follow."
1431,5435,6955088,9/1/13,6170318,Jen,"I love Carla's place! The neighborhood is amazing. The subway is RIGHT there. The apartment is super cute. Great view of the river. AND THE PARK IS HER BACKYARD! She is literally STEPS from Riverside Park which is my favorite park in all of NYC. So green, so much to do. Yay! Great door people at her apartment and I felt completely safe the entire time. Bonus is that the washers and dryers can be operated with a debit/credit card. Plus the laundry room is the nicest I have ever seen. Carla was easy to get a hold of and very accommodating. Her home is decorated beautifully and there was a nice breeze coming from her windows. Lots of closet space too. I had a great time in NYC and loved the apartment a ton. So quiet and clean. I would come back in a New York minute. Tons of great places to eat within blocks of her house. Also the Starbucks is two blocks away and the baristas are super nice there! I love the Upper West Side. So quiet and calm compared to Downtown. I enjoyed the slower vibe and appreciated that I could jump on the 1 train and be Downtown in minutes. Great stay all around.Yay!"
1432,5435,9550903,1/2/14,8359432,Charlotte,"My sister and I went to New York for the winter holidays and our stay at Carla's apartment was great. Her place is really cute and 2 blocks from the subway (and Starbucks and a whole bunch of nice restaurants and stores). The 1-train can take you anywhere so it's really handy, you don't waste time. One of us slept in the bed, the other one on the sofa, the temperature was great (it was freezing outside). Her shower is the best ever ... The people downstairs are really nice, they can help you with any problem. We would definitely recommend Carla's place!Merci pour tout et bonne annÃ©e! : )"
1433,5435,96507592,8/23/16,8166964,Claudio,"First time withAirbnb, beautiful experience, the place was as expected and Carla is very nice! She was there for my check in, it was late evening because of my flight (and MTA work in progress...).The building is also very very good and the people were super nice indeed, it was like being home, perfect.The shower was stunning and helpful for the August in NY (very hot this year) also I slept very well, and the communications with Carla and her nice friend were flawless.I really enjoyed the whole experience and I recommend Carla's apt, she is a wonderful person and host, thank you Carla for your hospitality, NY was better this time!"

1438,5803,5554,7/14/09,24880,Muriel,Booked this on behalf of my daughter so didnt stay there myself. My daughter confirmed the house was not as clean as expected but Laurie was in the middle of having some work done on the house. Only stayed for two of the four nights booked as circumstances changed.  Lauried very kindly gave refund for one of the nights not used.

1441,5803,11515,9/27/09,24309,Dieter,"There are some beers in the fridge said Laurie at the end of our phone call. This is a sentence one might expect when calling home. And not of a stranger calling from Manhattan to Brooklyn to state the time of arrival.I'd rather not use the hackneyed phrase. A home away from home.But I will anyhow. Laurie's little house in a ""Starbuck-free-zone"" in Park Slope Brooklyn. An area just like a clichÃ©-laden European would imagine. Her house, full of books,  pictures. The splendid guest room. Most impressive of all, however is Laurie and her son, Peter. Generous, friendly and helpful. Laurie gave me some good tips. E.g. BAM, Barke-Music, Gospel concert. And when I come back to Brooklyn again, I know there will be a beer for me in the fridge.Dieter, D. Germany"
1442,5803,12441,10/4/09,40215,Jean-Claude,"We stayed only a few days but it was above our expectations. Laurie is a great Host and a gold mine of infos about Brooklyn and NYC also. Her place is quiet, clean and well located. We strongly recommend it, you'll feel a little a bit like home. Laurie we got a super deal for a brand new Krups' toaster-oven at 80$ at Richards.Best regards to you and Peter.Jean-Claude and Suzelle from Montreal."
1443,5803,12761,10/7/09,39686,Colin,"Laurie was a very gracious hostess and we felt right at home.  She is very knowledgable about the local community and the city overall and full of good ideas about activities in the area.  The house itself is beautiful and clean with two friendly cats and of course Peter too.  The location is great, close to Manhattan but walking distance to good bars and restaurants in Brooklyn too.  We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  Thank you! "

We felt so relaxed and comfortable it was like being at home. The house is a dream and an inspiration in Art and Style. We will be back and have all ready recommended it to our friends. Janet & Les Ross."
1448,5803,17493,11/16/09,47703,Marjan,Laurie is a great hostess who loves to share her beautiful home.  She makes great coffee and offers wonderful pastry for breakfast while sharing her discount tickets for broadway shows.

1450,5803,20258,12/14/09,14794,Vesna,"Thanks so much for a memorable Brooklyn experience, Laurie and Peter.  The bed was super comfortable and everything you could possibly need was provided.  The house is located in a quiet street which was a nice contrast to the crowds and ambience of Manhattan.  Park Slope is home to so many great restaurants and live music venues which Laurie recommended--her knowledge and passion for the local area was clearly obvious, and she was keen to make sure you got the best out of her neighborhood.  You'll immediately feel right at home.  "
1451,5803,22750,1/3/10,39018,Alfredo,Thanks for everything Laurie. You have a lovely home. The shops on 5th Avenue are conveniently nearby & the subway lines are just a few steps away. Our room was homey & the bed was comfy.

1453,5803,24899,1/26/10,69884,Jeri,"This was the first time I ever tried this kind of accommodation, and what a pleasant experience it was. Laurie's home is beautiful and spacious. It makes you feel like you are a resident of New York, instead of a Visitor. I came to Brooklyn for a week long Workshop. The close access to the Subway, and minutes away from Manhattan was extremely convenient. I loved my room and the internet access was great. The bed was comfy and the room charming. It is a nice, quiet and safe neighborhood. I plan to come back for another Workshop this year, and I will stay with Laurie again if my room is available. Her 2 cats, Batman and Robin are adorable."

Laurie and Peter are welcoming and...Laurie's breakfast is perfect!The pictures really can't tell you how amazing her home is. The rooms and beds are cozy, clean and confortable as is the bathroom. Batman and Robin are the sweetest kitties. We love them. I would recommend Laurie's bandb again and again. I hope to go back and to bring friends and family as well. FIVE STARS all the way! "

Like everyone else has said; everything was clean, the beds were comfy; the breakfast was delicious; the cats were hilarious; and I would ad that Laurie's welcoming nature & willingness to share her wealth of NY knowledge with her guests was a HUGE blessing as well.  Staying with Laurie & Peter (and Batman & Robin!) made our NY experience awesome!  Thanks so much!!"
1456,5803,31268,3/25/10,70464,Gabby,"We stayed at Laurie's place in Brooklyn for 6 nights while on our US trip. Laurie is the perfect host - she even had our baby at east within seconds of meeting her. You can grab breakfast (bagels and OJ, yum!) before leaving and her place is a short subway ride from Manhattan. Thank you again for the stay Laurie, it made our NY experience even richer.Gabby, Mench and Julian"
1457,5803,33160,4/4/10,68299,Andy,"We had a great time staying at Laurie's house. It was really quiet and comfortable for sleeping, easy to get to, and Laurie was really helpful with her advice.

I hope we can stay with Laurie again on a future trip to NYC."
1458,5803,70400,7/29/10,86041,Alexandre,"Le sÃ©jour passÃ© chez Laurie Kellogg  fut vraiment trÃ¨s agrÃ©able. Laurie est charmante, attentionnÃ©e et s'occupe trÃ¨s bien de ses hÃ´tes. Les chambres sont trÃ¨s confortables, spacieuses, bien dÃ©corÃ©es, avec une touche trÃ¨s personnelle qui donne cette impression d'Ãªtre chez soi. Le petit dÃ©jeuner, pris dans le salon principal est toujours trÃ¨s copieux et bien Ã©quilibrÃ© (Ã  volontÃ©, bagles &cream cheese, fruits, cÃ©rÃ©ales, jus d'orange bio, lait, etc...); AprÃ¨s avoir marchÃ© pendant des heures dans NY, nous avions accÃ¨s Ã  la cusine pour prÃ©parer un repas, et ensuite nous prÃ©lasser dans le salon. Le quartier est particuliÃ¨rement attrayant Ã  quelques minutes de Prospect park (profiter de la fraicheur du matin pour aller faire un petit jogging) des rues calmes, des restos sympas, des clubs de musique, et beaucoup d'infos de la part de Laurie pour que le sÃ©jour laisse un souvenir inoubliable.Last but not least, nous n'avons pas eu de surprises dÃ©sagrÃ©ables par rapport Ã  ce que nous avions espÃ©rÃ© en voyant le site de Laurie sur Air B&B, et nous recommandons cette adresse les yeux fermÃ©s."
1459,5803,73964,8/5/10,106834,Sarah,"This was our very first time with AirBnB and we loved it. Laurie's place is really comfortable, nice and quiet, with a real warm and friendly atmosphere; we definitely felt like being at home. Laurie has been really helpful, with lot of tips about places to go and restaurants to dine in the neighbourhood; her house is within easy reach from the nearest metro station, and just a few subway stops from Manhattan. Laurie is an open-minded, talkative nice woman, we really loved chatting with her and we would have had more time to spend with her. Hope to come back soon!"
1460,5803,77737,8/13/10,155330,Mary Ellen,"We had a wonderful time in Brooklyn with Laurie (Peter was away at camp).  We had the top floor to ourselves during most of our week-long stay.  Laurie provided plenty of ideas of things to do.  The location was ideal.  We walked down to the DUMBO area a couple of times, easily took the subway into Manhattan, and attended an outdoor concert in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, which we would not have learned about had we been in a hotel.  There are numerous restaurants nearby, both eat-in and take out, as well as several grocery stores/delis.  We ate many meals in the park, enjoying the warm weather.  Laurie was very generous with the use of her computers, which was very helpful in allowing my daughter to keep up with her friends on (Hidden by Airbnb) , and even to connect up with them in New York.    We would definitely contact Laurie again if visiting New York."
1461,5803,79945,8/17/10,86923,Tecla,"We spent wonderful days thanks in her lovely home, we felt verywell the rooms were comfortable as the whole house.

1462,5803,92957,9/8/10,103157,Jennifer,"My 79-year-old parents recently stayed at Laurie's for a few weeks (with a break to go to DC for 3 nights, during which their luggage was graciously stored) and they loved the place. They were in New York to visit grandchildren in Park Slope, and the house is conveniently situated near bus and subway lines. It was very clean, homely and Laurie was most obliging and welcoming, providing anything they desired (Weetabix, bedside lamps, fruit salad!) upon request."
1463,5803,97406,9/15/10,118654,Pauline,We enjoyed our stay with Laurie and Peter. Great location. Laurie was very welcoming and we felt at home straight away.

What a place, what a deal and what a site... Thanks to airbnb I was able to enjoy Brooklyn and Manhattan.  Her house is so close to the sub way, but Brooklyn is a must see place too.  Thank you soo  much!  Your son and cats just add to the experience.  The Australia couple are now friends.  I will be back.  Heather"
1465,5803,113397,10/7/10,184042,John And Nathan,We stayed 5 nights in Laurie and Peter's home and cam't imagine a more comfortable accommodation in Brooklyn.  Laurie is quite involved in her community and she loves Brooklyn.  She took us to Red Hook to me some of her artist friends and gave us a bit of a tour around the area.  She obviously loves her neighborhood.  I would recommend this home to anyone.  Thanks Laurie and Peter.
1466,5803,120645,10/17/10,230418,Tatiana,"It was my first time to use such kind of accommodation instead of hotels and I liked it very much. Laurie's house is amazing, the room is cozy and quiet, the bed is comfortable, everything is very clean and has really warm atmosphere, breakfast is very good and the cats are sweet. The location is very quiet and convenient, 5 minutes walking to subway - and in 15-20 min you are in Manhattan! NYC is great, worth visiting again and again, and Park Slope is the best place to stay. Laurie is a great host, very helpful, very clever and with good sence of humor. I enjoyed my staying with Laurie and definitely will come back.Highly recommended to everybody."

The room had great morning light, the house is peppered with beautiful illustrations and there are books galore. What more could you ask for?! I felt so welcome and taken care of by way of recommendations for restaurants, cool places to see and things to do.  I would one-hundred percent recommend staying with them. I can honestly say that I not only had a great time but I have  made two wonderful friends. Thank you so much Peter & Laurie! :-)"
1469,5803,153282,12/13/10,305045,Diego,"Un buon posto dove soggiornare per brevi periodi a New York se siete in compagnia di altri con cui condividere la vostra camera (anche se foste da soli dovreste pagare la camera per intero, a quel punto trovereste qualcosa anche a Manhattan, se le vostre intenzioni sono quelle di visitare questa zona della citta'). Laurie ed il figlio sono davvero ospitali (Batman e Robin due micioni in cerca di coccole), la casa e' a completa disposizione dell'ospite... il frigo e' sempre ben rifornito di succhi, latte e quant'altro possa necessitare per una buona abbondante colazione. Si raggiunge il centro di Manhattan in circa 25 min di metro, la fermata piu vicina alla casa di Laurie dista appena 5 minuti a piedi. in definitiva l'esperienza a casa di Laurie e' stata sicuramente positiva.Diego"

Laurie herself is a wonderful person, as well as a great source of information: her knowledge of Brooklyn and NYC in general is impressive! Also, the house's location itself is very convenient, be it for the subway station or just shops and good restaurants. We strongly recommend staying here - it is well worth it - and we're sure you'll enjoy it as much as we have."

It was nice of her to have breakfast items available. The room was spacious and the location was great for exploring Brooklyn as well as Manhattan (very close to the F/G/R trains). This was my first airbnb experience and it was definitely a good one!"
1474,5803,213942,3/31/11,103074,Paul,"Laurie is a generous host who imparts info about Park Slope restaurants, provides terrific bagels and orange juice, cereal, etc. and shares her wonderful, spacious home with interesting travelers who get to know one another. Her quiet neighborhood in Brooklyn is ideal for exploring Prospect Park, 7th Avenue hotspots, and close to subways for getting to Manhattan in a short time. Check out the TKTS site at the Jay Street/Metrotech stop to get 50% off Broadway tickets. Much less crowded than the Times Square location. I also recommend trying the Moutarde Bistro at 239 5th Ave about a mile north of Laurie's for a great French meal at reasonable prices. All in all, a great place to stay."

Staying in Brooklin was no disadvantage at all, quite quickly to Manhattan by subway and having the oppotunity to see sites in Brookling we would not have seen otherwise. Laurie is a wonderful hostess, very helpful, interested in art and very educated too.Nearby are a few really nice restaurants, which we eventually preferred to places in Manhattan, cheaper and good quality.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.Linde and Peter"

Definitely recommend to others."

My daughter and I enjoyed staying in her cosy home, and walking the neighborhood.  By the time we left, we felt like locals using the subway and enjoying all that the city has to offer. We'd definitely recommend a stay at Laurie's in Brooklyn, as both a way to stretch your travel dollar and also as having a fabulous location to explore. Being in Brooklyn didn't prevent us from attending theatre in New York, going to museums or visiting Central Park."

Laurie makes you feel really relaxed, the house is lovely, the cats (Batman and Robin) are cute and we slept so well.  Laurie gave us lots of ideas about where to eat and things to do.  Breakfast was lovely with great products.  We want to go back to New York because it's a great city but also because we want to stay with Laurie.  We don't hesitate to recommend her to you!

Laurie is an amazing host, a knowledgeable tour guide of New York, and a museum curator all in one.  Her home is in a great part of the city, yet on a side street where I never had a problem parking just a few feet from her front door.  Her house could be a Better Homes and Garden showpiece, and yes, it even has a large garden in her back yard.  There is artwork and books everywhere.  In fact, the photos on Airbnb don't even do justice to the beauty of the place.  The rooms are large, immaculate, and the beds are comfortable.  The espresso maker in the kitchen and fresh croissants and OJ every morning was a treat, and much better than even Starbucks can deliver!  The house management team, Batman and Robin (Laurie's two cats), were friendly and ever-present.  I couldn't think of a nicer place to stay.  "

We were made to feel really welcome with our young daughter and Laurie went out of her way to share tips and ideas for places to visit.

It was really useful  to have access to lots of maps, magazines and information about New York, and we really enjoyed our chats with Laurie- it was great to meet someone so passionate about her city.The neighbourhood is fantastic- we ended up enjoying Brooklyn so much that we spent most of our time exploring the local area. We really appreciated the hospitality which we received and we are delighted that it made Tove's first trip to NYC so special. Thank you- and we hope it is not long before we return. "

The house is located in a wonderful, safe and pedestrian-friendly neighbourhood in Brooklyn -- with a great choice of restaurants, cafes and bars, all within short walking distance. There are also two easily accessible subway stations nearby for getting around the city. As a result, we had no problems efficiently getting around Brooklyn and Manhattan from this location.  Laurie herself was an excellent host, and a fantastic source of information for where to go for dining and entertainment, as well as for  getting around New York and Brooklyn. She also appeared to know quite a bit about the historical and cultural side of the city. (One of my regrets was not getting enough time to talk to her about this side of the city)  The house itself is a walk-up with beautiful spacious interior (the photos on the website don't exaggerate). The house is filled with a wonderful array of art -- in fact, one of my daily pleasures was lingering over the drawings and paintings as I walked up and down the stairs in the morning. The room we had was cozy, warm and private, and the bathroom was clean and maintained throughout our stay. In short, we couldn't hoped for a safer, more well-kept place for our visit. My partner and I were surprised as to how much we lucked out finding this place for our New York trip, given that this was the first time we had used Airbnb.  We intend on coming back here again when we visit N.Y. next time."

Our stay was perfect, Laurie's place is just next to the metro wich is fine if you want to visit Manhattan, but is also a cosy place to come back to after an intense day in the city. The room and the breakfast were fine, and Laurie has been a very good host explaining us how to move with public transportation. We had also the opportunity to experience the everyday life of Brooklyn wich is something more than just being tourists in Manhattan. And if you love cats you should meet Batman and Robin!"
1494,5803,865304,1/16/12,898248,Patrick,"I had a most enjoyable stay.  The building is close to public transportation and a short walk to several great bars and restaurants.

Highly recommended.Pat Brennan"

My family will be eternally grateful for her amazing warm hospitality to my daughter Dana  who needed a place to stay for two weeks between apartment changes. I'm  writing the review since Dana is in move- in mode today, but she could not have been more thrilled with her stay. We  met Laurie after a six hour drive from upstate to assist in the apartment search, and she was kind and lovely. This was my first introduction to airbnb, and find it hard to believe you will find any nicer stay than this one!!! Amazing area, lovely and clean house....but mostly, just a warm feeling environment. Thank you Laurie."

The house is remarkably 'homely' and conveniently placed in Park Slope to  great shops, restaurants, amenities and services. Laurie is a superb host helpful, attentive and  and very kind. The house has style and is very  comfortable but with some stairs  to climb that need good legs. But the effort is more than made up for by the pleasant surprises in store for the European visitor in particular, and the engaging conversations  to be had with Laurie and her brother Colin. Warmly recommended!--Manlio This was such an incredibly lucky find.  A large old house full of charm, very comfortable and the bed was like drifting on a cloud - seriously!This old world experience included the wonderful hospitality and friendliness of Laurie (the B&B owner and host) who is a veritable mine of information regarding places to go, how to get there and much time is saved by recommending places to eat. Talking of food, oh those almond croissants!  Many thanks to you and your son for a great stay. Your two lovely cats, Batman and Robin, also made us feel very much at home!

1498,5803,1098004,4/8/12,1757068,Mel,"Laurie was just brilliant. It felt like staying with an old friend. Laurie is so very helpful and caring about what she does. Her hospitality started way before my friend and I arrived with her friendly emails, giving us advice about how best to travel to her home from the airport, and about money off vouchers for bike rental in Central Park. We arrived at her home really late, and Laurie and her brother Colin were there to welcome us with a glass of wine, and Colin even took our huge cases up the stairs. Laurie lent my friend a coat whilst we were staying- as it was colder than we had expected. I visited New York partly as a tourist, but also to visit my daughter who is studying over there. Laurie was so kind in allowing my daughter to stay over one night. We slept in Peters room, which was great. That meant so much to me as it meant my daughter and I could be together late at night. Staying in Peter's room also meant that it was ok for Robin and Batman- Laurie's lovely cats- to snuggle up with me, just like my cat at home does. However, it was also no problem to keep the cats out of our room if we wanted to.My friend and I shared the room on the top floor which was a lovely light room at the front of the house and shared the bathroom with Colin- which was never a problem. The bed was comfy, and Laurie provided towels, boxes of tissues- and there was even a hairdryer. The shower was just great. One morning Laurie cooked us breakfast- and again it was just like being a friend sitting up at the breakfast bar watching her cook bacon and French toast. Other mornings we chose to wander up the road, as we found a little local cafe that we enjoyed going to. The area was perfect after hectic days out walking in the city- we often came back quite late, and it always seemed safe, quiet and calm.I would have no hesitation in recommending a stay with Laurie. Much more friendly than staying in an impersonal hotel room. I hope that I will return, and also hope that I keep in contact with Laurie. Both Laurie and Colin have a great sense of humour.Two regrets- that we didnt go to the bar on Sunday night to listen to music- we were too tired.- And that I didnt take any photos of Laurie, Colin and her cats.-Oh!! and a third regret!! We didnt really get to know Laurie's son Peter- he wasnt around much."

It is close to 2 subway stops that give you easy access to other areas of Brooklyn, plus Manhattan and Queens. (About 20 minutes from Lower Manhattan). The breakfast was good too - Laurie put on breads, croissants and jams, plus a coffee maker and made it clear that you are to make yourself at home. The rate as extremely reasonable and allowed us to spend more time in New York than we could if we had stayed solely in Manhattan. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend"

Laurie's place is the perfect retreat in the big city - quiet, comfortable and homey, we'd never consider staying anywhere else.  As always Laurie was the perfect host - armed with a wealth of information on restaurants, museums and other activities to keep us busy. In fact, more like a friend that a host, conversation was always interesting and fun. The bagels and croissants provided each morning were the perfect start to the day, not to mention the excellent coffee. It was also great to see the adorable resident cats - Batman and Robin - once again. The neighbourhood has changed a little since our last visit but only in a positive way - there are now even more fantastic restaurants and bars to try out and many are right on the doorstep. Park Slope really is the perfect base to sample all of what Brooklyn has to offer and apparently there is a small island called Manhattan not too far away if you run out of things to do! "

1518,5803,4608480,5/15/13,805812,Robin,Laurie's home is charming and she is an excellent host. The apartment is located near the subway and walkable to many nice restaurants in Park Slope.  
1519,5803,4684579,5/20/13,6040793,Nicolas,"Laurie was an excellent host. She knows really nice spots in Brooklyn and Manhattan. She was very helpful when we needed information about the city.Her place is beautiful, near the metro and near from really cool restaurants and bars. Beds were very confortable! And breakfast was delicious!"
1520,5803,5378626,6/27/13,4642772,Cristina,"Laurie is much more than a host, but a dedicated friend who makes almost everything for the guests to feel welcome. She gave us many nice tips about places to go (the Mermaid Parade, for example, that was unforgettable!). The house is located in a safe neighborhood, (lots of trees and birds), five minutes by walking to subway. I recommend her home for everyone who wants more than just a place to sleep while visiting New York city, but a house full of art, who offers a real experience of life."
1521,5803,7078969,9/5/13,1490706,Noel,"Laurie's place was perfect for my stay - I was visiting my young daughter who lives in Park Slope, and Laurie's house is at the dead centre of the neighbourhood, well placed for the subway and slightly south of the rather uber-trendy Slope further North.We had, when at home, the run of the thru lounge and garden. Other people staying were great company. Well stocked fridge etc. Cats good company too...Laurie very welcoming and easygoing and treated the three loud toddlers wandering her lounge with care and kindness.Not ideal if you want to be alone, and unless you are in the basement flat you are sharing a bathroom, but these are minor issues and the place is great value."
1522,5803,7766687,10/2/13,2528458,Ryan,"Park Slope is an amazing neighborhood to stay in, so much so that I moved here with my family from Ireland. We stayed with Laurie for a couple of weeks while we looked for a long term apartment and would highly recommend staying in the large bedroom which we lodged in for the last few nights of our stay with Laurie (in addition to the stay we had in the basement apartment).There is plenty of space in the room which means you can store pltny of luggage and still have space to move around. There is also a bathroom on each floor so there was never any queues to get in!  Laurie provides a selection of great local foods for breakfast and guests have access to the backyard which was great for my young son as was the washer and dryer for laundry.Laurie provided a wealth of helpful advice, was very easy going, friendly, welcoming and very accommodating and flexible to suit her guests which made a real difference to our stay. Laurieâ€™s two cats are also very friendly and love meeting new people.I would highly recommended booking a stay with Laurie if you would like to visit the area. "
1523,5803,8134602,10/17/13,3778619,Carol,"This was my second stay at Laurie's in one of the third floor bedrooms. The bedroom overlooked her beautiful back garden, was spacious, comfortable, and quiet. My daughter lives five blocks away, so Laurie's is very convenient for me. I felt safe walking ""home"" to Laurie's in the evenings. I liked being able to enjoy coffee and breakfast each morning. Laurie always asks what kind of breakfast foods you like, and they ""magically"" show up on the table ready for you to partake of. Laurie and her son are friendly, helpful, and so accommodating. Her rates are very reasonable too! There is a well-stocked 24 hr. grocery store a half block away, and other types of stores, restaurants etc. a short distance away. I look forward to my next visit to Brooklyn and a stay at Laurie's."
1524,5803,8279213,10/23/13,1232843,Harm,"We had a great time at Lauries beautiful Park Slope house with wonderful garden, packed with squirrels. We loved the atmosphere of both house, street and neighbourhood and thus learned a lot more about New York then the usual Manhattan, really a great experience.Laurie was a perfect and thoughtfull host from the moment of reservation, providing lots of useful information and tips for worthwhile addresses and restaurants. Perfect was also the travel info which made us travel quickly from Park Slope to lots of interesting places in Dumbo, Williamsburg (market/shops), Meatpacking (High Line) and Harlem, and don't forget Brooklyn Museum!Furthermore Laurie made us really feel at home with daily a perfect breakfast. We surely will be back, thanks for a lovely stay Laurie. Harm and Petra."
1525,5803,8821994,11/19/13,2293395,Theofilos,"Although we haven't extensively used airbnb in the past, we have to admit that this was a surprisingly great experience for us.We arrived at Laurie's around 11.30pm and not only she wasn't bothered by the late time, she also spent the next hour and a half to explain and discuss with us all the things we could do in NY.Her information was spot on and we never regretting following her recommendations. She has a great taste for theatrical plays and is very well informed with what is going on in the town.The place itself is located in a lovely and safe street only 3 blocks from the subway station that can take you to Manhattan in no more than 20-25 minutes. Art is overflowing in the place and Laurie is happy to explain where everything comes from.Having an uncle who has been an F1 champion as well as an autograph from Roger Federer is always a bonus!!!Batman and Robin (her two cats) are very well behaved and add to the great experience.Rooms (both bedrooms and common rooms) and bathrooms were very clean and tidy.To sum up, Laurie and her lovely place contributed in having a lovely time in NY and also saved some money during the trip.If we ever go back to NY we wouldn't look for another place to stay !!"
1526,5803,9055524,12/3/13,8341565,Gulsum,"We stayed at Laurie's place for five nights. It was our first airbnb experience & really a good choice. We spent most of our time in Manhattan but had the opportunity to explore Brooklyn during the last day thanks to Laurie's suggestions. Laurie is a great host and the place is exactly the same as in the picture. Rent her place, listen to her suggestions and enjoy NYC. "
1527,5803,9493797,12/31/13,8826277,Julie&Chido,"My daughter and I enjoyed very much staying with Laurie, she was very helpful, lots of information on what to see, transport and mad us feel very welcome in her home"
1528,5803,11009945,3/17/14,42273,Dani,"We stayed at Laurie's place for 4 nights for a family gathering. I am a fellow Airbnb host and needed extra space for my visiting family. You will not find a more gorgeous home and friendlier atmosphere than at Laurie's place! The rooms are lovely and the beds very comfortable. The price is also so so reasonable. Park Slope is one of the nicest and most popular neighborhoods in all of NYC and there is so much to see and do right near by. However, if you want to go into Manhattan (you hardly need too!) Laurie's place is just a quick walk to the subway to get into Manhattan in 20 minutes! Lastly, Laurie is such a great host who makes you feel relaxed and right at home. You really can't do better than Laurie's place! But book early because she gets full fast!"
1529,5803,11912280,4/19/14,10831414,Susana,"Notre sÃ©jour chez Laurie a Ã©tÃ© vraiment merveilleux. Sa maison est accueillante et il fait bon vivre Ã  Brooklyn. De plus, Laurie est une personne vraiment adorable et elle n'hÃ©sitera pas Ã  vous conseiller pour savoir oÃ_ manger les meilleurs pancakes ! Nous y retournerons sans hÃ©siter ! Encore merci Ã  elle !"

1531,5803,12995913,5/17/14,9834544,Maria,"We (me and my family) had a great week in Park Slope! Laurie is a great hostess. Welcoming, friendly, open, straight forward and very helpful. The rooms (we rented four rooms in total) were all nice, spacious and clean. In addition the house had a nice garden which Laurie generously let us use for a family barbecue. We spent a lot of time in Brooklyn but getting into Manhattan was no problem since the subway is only a 5 minute walk away. "

I am happy she is of fan of my work! Thanks for your support Laurie! "
1534,5803,15985690,7/19/14,7170476,Stephanie,"Very beautiful house in a friendly neighboorhood with really good access to Manhattan and all other areas.... I was staying with Laurie for 10 days, the room was nice with a comfortable bed and air conditioning.  Laurie was very helpful with any issues I had during my stay... problems with the taxi driver, maps for New York, restaurants etc. Also she took care of my laundry, what was really nice. What is important for guests to know is that there are other guests on the same floor, so you have to share the bathroom. Laurie has a helpful son and two nice cats, so donÂ´t be afraid of Badman and Robin (the cats), because they might jump to your bed in the middle of the night..... :) Would recommend this place!"
1535,5803,17152663,8/8/14,14216096,Staffan,"We (me and my wife) had an amazing time at Laurie's place. But let me take this in three steps: the location, the house and the host. Laurie's place is located in a relatively quiet street between two nice avenues full of restaurants, stores, cafÃ©s and other cool stuff and it's only a few blocks (about 5 minutes walk) from the metro which goes straight to Manhattan. Super nice neighborhood. Perfect location i would say. The house itself was lovely. There are three floors (or four if you will, there's a basement too): the bottom floor with a living room and kitchen, the second floor with two rooms and a bathroom, and the third floor with two rooms and a bathroom as well. We stayed in one of the rooms on the third floor. It worked out great. The only thing was that the wifi didn't reach the whole way up which could be a little bit frustrating, but it worked fine in the living room/kitchen. Also the hose was clean. Laurie was a great host. She was so helpful from the very beginning and gave us a lot of help in different ways. She served breakfast every morning (good breakfast too!) which was nice and comfortable. She also gave some advices what to do in the city and it was very fun to just hang out with her, a really nice person. If you are considering renting a room, all I can say is that it worked really well for us and we had a very good time there and I can definitely recommend it!"
1536,5803,17304429,8/10/14,18585803,Cindy,"Warm welcome, left suitcase in living room with no worries, had a great cup of coffee! Directions to lodging were excellent."

Le lendemain au petit dÃ©jeuner elle nous a donnÃ© qqs explications en franÃ§ais sur les visites Ã  faire et nous a remis  les clefs de sa maison pour que nous puissions aller et venir Ã  notre guise . Chaque matin nous nous servions dans son rÃ©frigÃ©rateur pour prÃ©parer notre petit dÃ©jeuner et faire ""comme chez soi"". La maison de Laurie est situÃ©e dans un quartier  trÃ¨s calme . Nous sommes souvent rentrÃ©s assez tard le soir sans jamais nous sentir en insÃ©curitÃ©. Le mÃ©tro est trÃ¨s proche du logement permettant d'accÃ©der en 3/4 d'heure environ Ã  Manhattan."
1538,5803,18259637,8/24/14,2131239,Dan,Laurie's house is a beautiful Victorian in a vibrant and interesting neighbourhood. The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was generous. There was a bike rental place nearby and we spent an entire day exploring Brooklyn from The Brooklyn Bridge to Coney Island.
1539,5803,19064736,9/6/14,11541435,Emmanuelle,Superbe sÃ©jour passÃ© chez Laurie. Laurie est accueillante et nous a donnÃ© de prÃ©cieux conseils concernant les restaurants et les Ã©vÃ©nements culturels se dÃ©roulant Ã  Manhattan et Ã  Brooklyn.

Laurie recommended great places for us to visit with directions and even some discount groupons. Batman and Robin are friendly and we had them at our door most mornings. If you are not a cat person you will definetly be once you meet them. The only complaint we have is with the wifi signal not reaching the 3rd floor of the house, but know for fact that Laurie is working on getting it fixed."

Lo mÃ¡s importante al hacer esta reseÃ±a es que nos hemos sentido como en nuestra casa, Laurie es una mujer muy cercana que te darÃ¡ toda la informaciÃ_n que solicites. El desayuno es muy completo (cafÃ©, tÃ©, chocolate, tostadas, bollerÃ_a fresca, queso, zumos, etc) te lo sirves tÃº con total libertad.

Muy buena comunicaciÃ_n. La Ãºnica pega, por decir algo, es el orden. Al tener tanta gente y Laurie trabajar no siempre estÃ¡ todo ordenado.

1543,5803,23996171,12/16/14,16879944,Allan,"Laurie is a very nice host.  Always ready to help or make you feel at home.  From the croissants served every morning to the laundry she offered to do for her guests.The house is gorgeous, big and full of light.  The backyard is also welcoming.The room is big with very nice linens, pillows, heating and a great desk to work or use your laptop.  (wifi does not work upstairs which is good because you must go to the living room to use it while you interact with other guests or Laurie).The bathroom is big and clean (you'll only share with the other guest in the next door room).The two cats are also welcoming and they don't refuse a warm human touch.The apartment is close to everything that's essential in Park Slope.  It is 3-4 blocks away from the G, N, R and F trains.  20 minutes from Manhattan.  But... why Manhattan???  You're in Brooklyn!!  Enjoy!!!I would definitely recommend Laurie's Listing."
1544,5803,25474884,1/17/15,22627,Julie,"Laurie is a very friendly, gracious host. She checked in with me a few times to make sure everything was acceptable. The neighborhood of Park Slope is great. It has lots of restaurants and shops within short walking distance of Laurie's home. I stayed in a room on the third floor of the house. A winding staircase leads to the room, and the bath is shared with any guest who might rent the other room on the floor (in my case, the other room was only rented out for the last couple of days of my stay). The bedroom and bath were both very clean and pleasant. I did not partake in breakfast, although Laurie made sure that breakfast was available in her kitchen."

Nothing is too much trouble for her, from staying up to greet us in the first night we arrived at 2.00am in the morning, having yummy breakfast supplies waiting for us everyday, recommending great cafÃ©s and shops, even doing our washing, which was totally unexpected. The room was lovely, comfortable and clean with everything you need. Overall a wonderful Airbnb experience. Thank you Laurie. "
1546,5803,29164465,4/5/15,12875475,Sara,Great stay in Laurie's beautiful home. Laurie gave us great tips on where to eat locally and left us breakfast evey morning. The house is in a quiet neighbourhood but within easy reach of Manhattan. Thank - you Laurie!!

The room was quite large and had good storage facilities for hanging clothes, etc. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was shared but still was more than serviceable. She went out of her way to ensure that we were comfortable and provided options for things to do both in Manhattan and locally."
1548,5803,31626500,5/8/15,14612191,Carly,"Laurie was nice, interesting and interested in our plans.  The bed was so comfortable and the room was full of books, especially ones my daughter had read as a young reader.  The shower was strong and hot. The fellow travelers were interesting.  The house is in a safe neighborhood and just blocks from the subway.  We (60 yo mom & 23 yo daughter) walked around at night and felt safe.  Laurie gave us lots of information about nearby restaurants.  She had bagels and chocolate croissants(yum) for us each morning. She has a wonderful garden in the back.  It took us about 30-40 minutes to get to downtown NYC on the subway from her house.  It was a great vacation!"

1551,5803,40438247,7/31/15,32731960,Chiara,"I was at Laurie's place in July with a friend of mine. Staying at Laurie's B&B was great! She is very nice and helpful, always ready to give great advice to her guests. Her house is very clean (even the bathroom) and her cats are lovely. If I ever happen to be in NYC again, I will definitely choose her B&B again!"
1552,5803,42814314,8/16/15,20531425,Kristina,Laurier property is pleasant and well located with Park Slope having good connections to various subway lines.

La maison est superbe, trÃ¨s grande pour une ville comme NYC, 2 Ã©tages et un jardin (et 2 chats trÃ¨s mignons). Le quartier est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able, il s'agit d'une des parties les plus jolies de Brooklyn : grand parc, rues bordÃ©es d'arbres, ambiance village et beaucoup de petits cafÃ©s (essayez le Barbes et l'Union Hall), restaurants et quelques endroits pour sortir. C'est un endroit idÃ©al si vous disposez d'un peu de temps pour visiter New-York et ne pas seulement faire Manhattan. Park Slope est trÃ¨s bien reliÃ© au centre, la maison est Ã  quelques dizaines de mÃ¨tres du mÃ©tro (lignes F, G, R). Il faut compter entre 30 minutes et 45 minutes pour se rendre au centre de Manhattan selon les lignes, ce qui est assez court pour une ville de cette taille. FacilitÃ© d'accÃ¨s aux coins Ã  la mode de Brooklyn comme Williamsburg, Brooklyn Heights (oÃ_ se trouve le Brooklyn Tabernacle pour aller Ã©couter du gospel, moins de monde qu'Ã  Harlem).Laurie est une hÃ´te discrÃ¨te mais qui connaÃ®t beaucoup sur la ville et saura vous aider elle nous a donnÃ© beaucoup de bons plans sur ce qu'il y avait Ã  faire dans la ville, notamment les concerts, les musÃ©es, les marchÃ©s. Par ailleurs, elle vous envoie un guide PDF trÃ¨s bien fait avec beaucoup d'adresses. Le petit-dÃ©jeuner (bagels, fromage, jus, cafÃ©) est inclus, ce qui est un plus. A savoir, si les trois chambres d'invitÃ©s sont remplies, il peut y avoir jusqu'Ã  7 personnes dans la maison, mais il y a de l'espace donc ce n'est pas gÃªnant.Nous sommes contents de notre voyage :)"

Laurie is a great host that arranges everything you need and is a kind and 'gezellig' (Dutch word, untranslatable...) person. Her little booklet on the house, New York and Brooklyn is a very handy guide to welcome you in the house and the city. And o yeah, the cats are very kind and cuddley too ;-)Thanks Laurie!"
1560,5803,90751104,8/2/16,4213410,Gary,Park Slope is my favorite neighborhood to stay... Great restaurants & cafes and easy access to subway. Laurie was very gracious and the accommodations were excellent! We enjoyed our stay and we plan come again next time we're in Brooklyn.

1564,5803,104800026,9/28/16,29792433,Greg,"Staying at Laurie's quaint Brooklyn home was probably the smartest decision of my entire trip--quiet, clean, comfy, and hassle free! I arrived at an odd (early morning) hour and Laurie was still completely accommodating and welcoming. My room was at the top of two flights of narrow, very creaky stairs, but it just adds to the atmosphere of the house. Just tread lightly if you arrive home late! My bed was a super comfortable queen size and was generously given three pillows for optimal sleeping.As far as getting around, it's a great location located in Park Slopes, less than a mile from Prospect Park and a few blocks away from two direct lines to the heart of Manhattan. Even at peak hours it never took me more than 30 minutes to get to Times Square. Laurie as a host was ideal; welcoming and friendly, but not overbearing or nosy. We had a pleasant conversation when I arrived and then I was left to my own devices to explore the city. If I had a question or needed a suggestion, she was on hand to give the best advice. Top quality host. Really made my vacation the relaxing breeze I needed it to be. I highly recommend giving Laurie's home a visit!"

1569,5803,149157021,5/2/17,21282389,Myrthe,"Laurie is a great host and the location is wonderful, not too busy and next to a lot of shops and restaurants."
1570,5803,151039082,5/10/17,21964299,Jeongin,Laurie was a great host. She knows so much about the neighborhood that it was super easy for us to navigate around the house. She provides an amazing breakfast each morning. Never imagined I could get complimentary breakfast at an Airbnb house. I had some good and bad Airbnb experiences but Laurie's house was so so great. I would stay there again and recommend it to anyone! 
1571,5803,153515438,5/21/17,9692601,Lia,"We had a wonderful stay at Laurie's place, while visiting with our daughter who lives in Park Slope.  Sharing the bathroom was not a problem, as we found all guests using it were mindful and courteous.  We appreciated all the extra amenities that Laurie provides: a good reading light on both sides of the bed, lots of room and shelves in the closet, a first aid kit in the bathroom, shampoo, conditioner, fresh and delicious croissants, bagels, cream cheese, organic milk and OJ for breakfast. . . all yummy and plentiful.   The backyard garden was at its prime and lovely.  What a gem we found.  Thank you, Laurie, and we hope to see you again!"
1572,5803,157143035,6/2/17,56281844,Stephanie,Laurie's place is really great! Close to subway (R and F ) so there's easy access into the city. It's on a quiet area in Park Slope but still close to everything the area has to offer in terms of restaurants and bars. The room is a good size and has everything anyone could need. Fair amount of closet space.  Beautiful garden.
1573,5803,162879074,6/22/17,111187766,Judy,"This is a great location close to lots of restaurants and stores, but also in a safe, residential neighborhood. Very clean."
1574,5803,199313510,10/1/17,3753684,Viruca,Una bonita casa en un barrio estupendo lleno de vida social. Bien comunicada con el metro. Gran hospitalidad. Pasamos unos dÃ_as maravillosos
1575,5803,202264311,10/10/17,127974,Anthony,"Our stay at Laurie's was wonderful from the very beginning, with lots of local tips and a full booklet with all the information you may want/need! The house was even more beautiful than on pictures, and the room was very (by New York standards: VERY) spacious. It felt very homey and we had a great time staying there and exploring the neighborhood and going for nice dinners close by. Subway is also only a couple min walk. Breakfast provided is a good plus. The garden and indoor decoration are very nice. Tree-lined streets of Park Slope are beautiful. Laurie was an amazing host by e-mail even though she had a last minute urgency that prevented us to meet each other, but she was very responsive and helpful - thank you again!"
1576,5803,213522325,11/21/17,7222215,Frances,"Charming house, great location, spotlessly clean, good communication all was as expected."
1577,5803,215063645,11/27/17,145883925,Deb,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Laurieâ€™s home. It is a funky, century old (if not more) house. If you want authentic Brooklyn, this is the place for you! The location is fantastic. Close to transit, shops, restaurants. The neighbourhood is safe and welcoming. The price is right as well.Laurie is kind and generous with information, tips, resources and breakfast treats. We will definitely be back."
1578,5803,215255784,11/28/17,63105155,Hilary,"Laurieâ€™s place was perfect for us. Accommodations were spacious and comfortable. Having access to a kitchen was great. Her location is a few minutes from subways and close to specialty markets of South Slope. Most of all, Laurie was at hand to answer all questions, welcome us warmly, and give us an expansive printout that oriented us to everything Brooklyn. She is gracious host!"
1579,5803,215410810,11/29/17,17689150,Kate,"Laurie's house is just a fantastic landing place in Brooklyn. She offers as much or as little as a traveler would want. She provides a wealth of suggestions for local restaurants, activities and overall things to do in the area. Her house is filled with fantastic art on the walls and a real cozy space to enjoy. I wouldn't stay anywhere else when traveling to the area."
1580,5803,215761639,12/1/17,150556350,Claire,Good value for the price!
1581,5803,216918331,12/6/17,10483740,Evie,Laurie opens her beautiful home to you relaxedly and with grace. Tons of thoughtfulness about YOUR particular stay and needs. Location couldn't be better. You'll never go hungry - gobs of great restaurants and easy walk to subway in and out of the city. The best place I've found to stay in NY!
1582,5803,223100404,12/31/17,161677119,Clara,Laurie's house was good to stay. Location is 2 blokcs away from the subway station. Everything was beautiful in the house. Especially I couldn't get up in the morning because the bed was perfect! I could eat everything in the freezer. You can stay with a reasonable price in BR!
1583,5803,243880444,3/17/18,70731536,Natalie,"Although this was my sixth trip to New York, my stay at Laurieâ€™s place in Park Slope was one of the most positive experiences. When I arrived, Laurie was extremely welcoming. Her home is located on a beautiful tree-lined street, located one or two blocks (in every direction) from stores and restaurants. The 5th Avenue bus stop is one block away . And the subway was a mere three-block walk. I liked the fact that it was quiet, even when other guests were staying in the house. I never heard my neighbors. Because I was busy with work and meetings, I didnâ€™t get to spend much time in in the place. But it was nice to come home to after a long day galavanting."
1584,5803,252924503,4/12/18,6367569,Katharina,"Laurie ist nicht nur ein wundervoller ""superhost"", sondern auch ein besonderer Mensch. Obwohl sie sich gerade erst von einer Operation erholt, hat sie sich liebevoll um mich gekÃ_mmert. Schon am 1. Abend hat sie mir alle Tricks und Kniffe des NYC Subwaysystems erklÃ_rt. Sie ist sehr ""parkslopy"" entspannt, was gut tut. Sie kann Dir tolle Tipps geben, was Museum, Essen, Musik, Taxigebrauch etc. angeht. AuÃŸerdem kannst Du mit ihr tolle GesprÃ_che Ã_ber amerikanische Politik fÃ_hren. Ihr Vater ist der berÃ_hmte Kinderbuch Autor und Maler Steven Kellogg. Das schÃ¶ne 3-stÃ¶ckige Haus hÃ_ngt voll mit seinen Zeichnungen. Eine tolle AtmosphÃ_re! Die Zimmer und das Bad werden professionell gereinigt. Du hast wÃ_hrend Deines Aufenthalts dort evtl. Mitbewohner, was schÃ¶n ist, aber nicht stÃ¶rend. Alles in allem eine tolle MÃ¶glichkeit in dem schÃ¶nen Brooklyn Park Slope zu wohnen."

1586,5803,271853956,6/2/18,179568445,Regan,"Laurie's place was wonderful! I was only there for a few days, but it could definitely have easily been comfortable longer term. The room's desk was good for working at, but I ended up being out in the garden most of the time since it was in full bloom this time of year. Felt like I was living in a loving home with an international heart. And on top of all that the fresh bagels, cream cheese, coffee, and laundry were as promised!"
1587,5803,276385341,6/13/18,191616150,Mahmudur,This is a wonderful place to stay. Park Slope is a great neighborhood.
1588,5803,286595581,7/6/18,13845901,Mark,"It's a reasonable size room for two people, with cozy bed and quality bedding. You don't get that in many short term visitor accommodation . The breakfast is very good, but nothing is actually ""served"". Unfortunately, there is no lounge space or kitchen possibilities other than breakfast, so you have to always eat out, which is not great in NYC because it runs up your costs of being ther big time. But, Laurie is an interesting character, with a lot of good advice, and seems she genuinely enjoys meeting new people with cool things to talk about. By NY standards, Park Slope is a very fun place to spend some days."
1589,5803,291190957,7/15/18,69084327,Ann,Laurie is an amazing host. She was very accommodating and provided me with a ton of information to make my visit special!

She's one of the best hosts in AirBnb I have ever met. Especially the night I arrived her home was very late, she was still waiting to meet us, and having warm conversations with us. It's not like some AirBnb, you cannot see and talk with the hosts. Laurie is always there.I highly recommend Laurie's place for  having great experience in Brooklyn NY.   "

1594,6021,6932,8/8/09,26407,Christopher,"Claudio's private guest room was exactly what I needed for a three day stay in NYC.  The location is fantastic - very close to both the subway and the park.  The room, bed, and bath were clean and quiet.  I would definitely recommend Claudio's place and I hope to stay there again next time I am in NYC.  This was my first time using airbnb to plan my accommodations and the experience has been great!"

It's very close to the subway (two blocks) and in front of Central Park! Very clean, safe, comfortable, bright. Claudio is very nice and polite person! He helped us with a lot of informations. We would highly recommend this place which we will come back for sure. Thank You again Claudio!"
1597,6021,9705,9/11/09,26993,Deborah,"My husband and I were scheduled to stay with Claudio the week of Labor Day in order to celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary.  On Aug. 18th my husband was on his way home from work on his motorcycle when a man turned in front of him.  He was admitted to the hospital.  I emailed Claudio the next day to cancel our plans and inquired about a refund.  Claudio said he couldn't refund the money but would let us come stay another date, which I appreciated.  The next day my husband unexpectedly died from his injuries.  I emailed Claudio again but did not hear back from him.Last week I emailed airb&b.  They spoke with Claudio and he agreed to refund 50% of our deposit. I really appreciate this very much.This morning my doorbell rang and the florist was standing there with a beautiful arrangement.  When I opened the card, it was from  airb&b.  I couldn't believe it!  This is such a great site!My children and I will certainly use this site in the future.Again, thanks to Claudio and airb&b!Deborah"
1598,6021,9967,9/13/09,34032,Annabel,"Late review but nonetheless deserved! Stayed at Claudio's in Sept 2009 with my mother and it was a great experience. He was a great host, the room was immaculate, the flat quirky, and we had no complaints! The flat is in a great location, right next to Central Park, minutes from the Subway and safe at night. Would definitely recommend him -and I just did to a friend, which is when I realised I hadn't written this! "

We would have liked to have known ahead of time that he had a roommate. Some mornings it was difficult to share a bathroom with four people (obviously we weren't all in there at the same time!). But it was a minor inconvenience and everything else was wonderful. Very clean, very comfortable, great neighbourhood, easy walk to the subway. I would recommend staying here. If you are a light sleeper, bring a face mask and (Website hidden by Airbnb) isn't loud per se, but it is on a main street and the subway runs under the building. My husband had no problems at all, but I'm very sensitive. Thanks Claudio!"
1603,6021,14363,10/20/09,39772,Kathryn,We had an excellent stay in NYC at Claudios. Room was just perfect for what we wanted. Room/bed very comfortable-spotlessly clean!

We got there, the room was very clean, the bed was confortable and even the sheets smelled like fresh laundry. it was so cozy that it felt like my own room. As for the shared bathroom, my friend and i had no problem, we never got to wait in line or anything since we always went out early morning. The towels and soaps were provided also. He even told us to use the kitchen, but didnt get to use it since we ate out all the time. Perfect location, right next to a beautiful park and easy to find! We only saw Claudio the first day and our last day :)  Thank you Claudio!"
1607,6021,25386,2/4/10,49826,Ed,Thank you Claudio. Just returned from ten days staying at Claudio's place. Very good location although we didn't see Claudio often as we were busy when we did he was very helpful and accommodating. Would not hesitate to stay there again. Great place.

Claudio's place, situated just opposite Central Park, with Columbia University not far away (cheap breakfast cafes if you wanna eat out) is perfect for visiting NYC! I really loved that place, very clean, very cosy, good bed, all fresh and clean, with fresh towels and soap. Claudio is a great guy and always helpful.

Cozy room and bed with a small LCD tv - very nicely furnished and super clean. Bathroom is shared but always tidy and clean; has a bathtub and soap is provided. Claudio is a great host - but we had very different schedules so didn't interact much at all. Only downside is the subway runs right next to the apartment, which is on the first floor, so the room could be really noisy at night and in the morning - consider using ear plugs if you're a light sleeper."

If you want to stay in the heart of Manhattan, in a clean, safe, and comfortable home, and at a nice affordable price, this is the answer. Do remember to pick up  earplugs for a good nights sleep.

You get your own stylish, comfortable and scrupulously *clean* room (you share the bath, but I always felt like I had it to myself). You can't cook, but you can use the refrigerator and microwave.The room has a comfortable bed, wardrobe, as well as it's own heater and AC, so you can be as warm or cool as you want--a big deal when it comes to comfort. Yes, you should bring earplugs, but that's true of almost any place in NYC because the traffic noise can be loud--but with earplugs I slept soundly, and I never heard any noise from within the apartment.Claudio gives you a set of keys, so you can come and go as you want--kind of like having your own apartment on fashionable Central Park West! And he was very accommodating about letting me arrive early--as well as leaving my bags until I was ready to go to the airport, then dropping off the keys. It couldn't have been an easier, more comfortable or pleasant stay.Claudio and Kiko are charming guys and great hosts (thank you!) I will definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to my friends."

1638,6021,148032,12/2/10,245697,Cliodhna,"I had a nice time staying at Claudio & Kiko's. We hardly ever ran into one another, so it didn't feel like you were really staying in someone else's home. Their place is warm, cozy and welcoming in a good central location. However, I did find the noise outside to be quite a disturbance - it's really load with traffic and the subway. But then again, the room is fairly priced by Manhattan standards - I guess chiefly because of the noise issue. "
1639,6021,149565,12/6/10,272665,Denka,"thank you very much Claudio, we enjoyed very much the stay at you place,it was very nice and warm, special thank for the flexible late receive."

They provided any info we needed and helped us feeling like home. A great location , close to the subway and with a beautiful window on Central Park... highly recommended!!Thank you very much, Claudio, we hope to hear from you again soon and... merry Christmas!!!:)"
1641,6021,163506,1/3/11,272313,Vivianny,"I've stayed at Claudio and Kiko  place for 6 nights and had a great time. The room is cozy with air condition, the place is nice and clean. It is very close to the subway with great connections and the area seemed fine to me. Kiko also helped with instructions and pointers what I should check out while staying in NYC. All in all, everything was great and according to promised. Thank you Claudio and Kiko."

Place is a block and a half basically from A-C line subway, which makes it very convenient for getting around. ItÂ´s across the road from Central Park and walking distance to Columbia University. Claudio was really nice and I immediately felt comfortable staying at his place. A lamp was always left on for when I came home late. The room has a closet with hanging space, a full length mirror, a heater, bed side lamp and there is wifi. It is also convenient that the apartment is on the first floor (no carting luggage up stairs). I didnÂ´t find the bedroom noise too bad. I would stay again! Thank you..."

Being just across the street from the Central Park, 20 minutes walk to 5th Avenue, Broadway or few steps from public transport that makes navigating the city so easy.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends and return here again. Thank you!"

1646,6021,207165,3/23/11,292232,Marilyn,"Very clean and comfortable. Two blocks from subway which was extremely convenient.  Neighborhood is safe and quiet, but you have to walk 4 blocks (10 minute walk) to get to a street with coffee shops and restaurants.  Room faces the street and the apartment is on the ground floor so you could hear people walking by and talking.  Also, since the subway runs underground along the street the apartment is on, you could hear the trains going by.  None of the above was an issue for me.   I would definitely stay here again."

Ottima disponibilitÃ  e libertÃ  all'interno dell'appartamento, Claudio e Chico ci hanno fatto sentire come a casa nostra. Abbiamo usato la cucina per la colazione, ed il frigo per mantenere il cibo. L'appartamento Ã¨ solamente a due isolati dalla metrÃ_ (103st). Le prime due notti il rumore della metrÃ_ ci ha fatto compagnia, ma con l'uso dei tappi per le orecchie Ã¨ stato risolto il problema ed abbiamo fatto delle belle dormite.

1651,6021,271551,5/20/11,315012,Patricia,"Convenient location. Very clean. High noise levels from subway, general traffic and  voices in the street directly outside the window. Ear plugs did not help very much. "

The location was also the very best, walk outside and you're in Central Park. We had our room (w/tv and ac), bathroom, and kitchen.

1658,6021,348998,7/3/11,247766,Valerie,I enjoyed my Manhattan stay very much! The room was quite comfortable and the passing noise on the street was never a problem for me. Claudio's home is very lovely and very clean! I will admit I was slightly nervous since this was my first stay with any Airbnb affiliate - but after that first initial meeting I knew my nervousness had no place. Claudio was very welcoming and helpful with information about the city. I could not have asked for a better host! Thank you very much for allowing me to stay in your home!
1659,6021,365614,7/11/11,562309,Yvette,Great value for money. Loved staying so close to Central Park. Easy to get on subway down into town. Friendly hosts. Would stay here again.

1663,6021,418991,8/4/11,396076,Rachael,"Claudio and his apartment were great! His apartment is right next to central park, a subway station and was super cute and clean. He gave us our own keys so we could freely go as we please! We are so glad that we decided to go this route in terms of accommodation in NYC. Some reviews said it was noisy from the subway/street but I don't know what these people are talking about...we could here some honking outside (which was minimal) but we never heard the subway or anything that kept us awake. I will most definitely recommend Claudio's place to any of my friends that will travel to Manhattan in the future...and when we go back, we will definitely stay here again. Thanks Claudio!"
1664,6021,425942,8/7/11,779117,Michael,Excellent simple location close to the tube station. Very nice and friendly host. Bedroom was very clean and we had internet access. Only downside was that it was a little noisy but I did not mind at all.

The appartement on 1st floor is quite noisy the 1st night but we get used to it very fast. This part of Manhattan is quiet and close to good jazz club.150m to the subway, you will be in the heart of Manhattan in 15-20 min. A very good quality/price ratio for Manhattan.Thanks Claudio!"
1667,6021,491882,9/1/11,354303,Ian,"Central place to stay and Kiko gave us a subway train map when we arrived which we appreciated. Bedroom looks out over Central Park rocks, and the street which is very noisy with trucks, train subway noises, night and day. Bed was not particularly comfortable and told to eat and drink in kitchen, however owners ate in their bedroom. Room was cheap & I suppose you only receive what you pay for. Great internet access. Owners did not see us off and we left keys in bedroom."
1668,6021,497932,9/3/11,924153,Sonia,"A very clean room and bathroom, immaculate bathroom, airconditing and  close to subway to all of New York, no noise and hosts were gracious.  Would do it again."

His apartment in the upper west side was more than we could've hoped for - clean, easy to get to (right near a subway station) and at a great price too.Claudio was very nice to talk to and respectful of our privacy. The wifi connection was super-fast and it was very straighforward communicating with Claudio.The apartment isn't in the downtown area, but it takes just a 10 min subway to get there, day or night. All in all, highly recommended!"
1671,6021,596189,10/4/11,651652,Guanzhen,"Great location merely one block away from the 103 St 'C' subway. Claudio and Kiko are friendly, helpful and non-intrusive. Apartment is clean. Location on the 1st floor means that you do not have to drag your luggage up flights of stairs or use the lift."
1672,6021,617921,10/11/11,34736,Janice,"Claudio and his partner Kiko are nice people.  They leave you alone to do your own thing.  The bedroom was very nice.  Bathroom was clean.  The only drawback was the bedroom was a half of a flight of stairs off of the street.  Walk-by traffic is moderate, street traffic is heavy and the subway is under the sidewalk  outside your window with the open grates in the sidewalk so you hear it as well.  I just brought a set of earplugs and that took care of the noise.  Good price for a nice bedroom.  "

Wish that I'd had a less hectic schedule for the time I was there, as it was fun talking with him.Looking forward to future visits to NYC and Claudio's place will be at the very top of the (very) short list!An Oasis in The City That Never Sleeps ...

Vi que alguns guests reclamaram de barulho durante a noite, mas eu nÃ£o tive problema nenhum quanto a isso - as noites de sono foram Ã_timas. Acabamos nÃ£o comprando nada de supermercado, entÃ£o sÃ_ usamos mesmo a cozinha para beber Ã¡gua. Claudio e Kiko sÃ£o pessoas agradÃ¡veis e nada intrusivos... nos deixaram bem Ã  vontade.

1676,6021,742634,11/25/11,258036,James,"This was my first trip to New York and my first time using Airbnb and both experiences were great. I'm actually still in the apartment waiting fort lift to the airport when I got the email to leave a review. My stay went very well when I arrived I was met by Claudio and he introduced himself and showed me the room and left me to get on with my trip. He was very helpful when I asked for some information, I didn't see him much as he went to Brazil but his partner Kiko was here who was also very helpful aswell as his assistant Who works here during the day. I would highly recommend staying here subway only 2 blocks away and it in Times Square in minutes and the area feels really safe also. Plus the price is very good u can't go wrongThe noise that other reviewers have talked about was not an issue at all!!!"
1677,6021,767720,12/6/11,1282528,Jose,"A friend and i stayed at Claudio's apartment, and we are so happy because we couldn't find a better host, he is so so so kind, and never bother us about time schedule or things like that.The place is awesome and very clean, just the idea to wake up right in front of the central park every single day, make me wanna go again. I wont think twice if i need to go to NYC again, of course if he let me, i will stay at his place again."

1681,6021,315347418,8/28/18,39552699,Curtis,"This is an amazing location - across the street from Central Park - for a very reasonable price. (Note, however, the fees are high relative to the nightly rate; this reduces the value a bit.) In fairness, for this review, the host was away the entire time, so I had the entire charming place to myself (except the host's locked locations). Since it is small, and one would be sharing the bathroom and kitchen with the host, the experience would necessarily be different. The small kitchen was nice, and well equipped. There is an excellent large (by NYC standards) market a few blocks away on 110th St at the NW corner of the park. Very close subway stop on 103rd St. Easy walk to Harlem, Columbia Univ, etc.The unit is on the bottom floor at street level, and the bedroom window opens onto the Central Park West sidewalk at street level. So one must expect some noise, as with any similar NYC location, and particularly with a window AC unit (reasonably quiet, but also a good source of white noise). There is also street light that leaks in, and in the morning light comes in early (east facing window). A good pair of earplugs, and an mask made sleeping - and sleeping in - easy and pleasant. Claudio's assistant Kiko - who handled all the arrangements on this occasion - was very pleasant, helpful and accommodating.

1684,6021,328253124,9/25/18,96892089,KeyUr,"Claudioâ€™s place is perfect, itâ€™s bang opposite Central Park, itâ€™s a bit away from the Center but at the price which it comes itâ€™s so worth it, and to get to the heart of the city and anywhere else it takes less then 10 minutes which is nothing. I got the whole place to myself as Claudio was travelling. And Kiko helped generously with any and everything. It was a delightful stay. Thank you for offering your house in New York! Definitely recommended."

Alina was great to deal with, really friendly, helpful and flexible with our travel plans. BIG THANKS :)"
1691,6090,41788,5/12/10,66133,Cate,"Alinas apartment, in the greatest location for a visitor to NY. Bleecker St is just gorgeous and we often found it took all day to just leave the immediate area as there are so many beautiful shops, cafes bars on beautiful tree lines streets. We liked the apartment as it was clean and sparse as; as a visitor staying in someones apartment I didn't want to be surrounded by their personal belongings! Having a well equipped kitchen was really useful for us. Bathroom was nice with lots of hot water, and nice fresh towels and sheets. It is up 5 flights of stairs, which after all day sightseeing sometimes we cursed BUT we got super fit! We had a really great time and I would highly recommend the apartment"
1692,6090,51184,6/9/10,68493,Philippa,"We had a wonderful 3 weeks honeymoon staying in Alina's fab West Village apartment. Bleecker St is a dream location with cafes and restaurants just seconds away as well as great boutiques. Also very near the subway so perfectly placed for exploring the city. The apartment is towards the north western end of Bleecker so you also get the benefit of it being relatively quiet in the evenings as there are mainly retail units below...The apartment is very light and airy (although be warned it's on the 5th floor but it's worth the climb)and benefits from WiFi and much appreciated air-conditioning (it was 30 degrees most of the time we we there!) There is a well equipped kitchen, great shower and plenty of closet space.Alina was a really friendly, helpful host (although we never met!) and provided us with all the advice and instructions we needed to make the rental go smoothly... We loved NYC especially the chilled out vibe of Greenwich Village. We definitely plan to return!"
1693,6090,59706,7/1/10,143803,MarkAnthony,"Alina's place was fantastic! Alina was wonderful to work with, organized, responsive, and thoughtful. My fiancÃ©e and I loved every minute we were at the apartment.  The location was 5 stars. The apartment was clean, open, neatly appointed without the feel of crashing in someone else's pad. Top floor, 5 story walk up, no problem for two San Franciscans. Plenty of light, air conditioner was great. We were able to walk to all the spots we had hoped for.  My fiancÃ©e visited all the boutiques in the neighborhood and shopped like there was no tomorrow. At the end of the day, coming home to Alina's place was like coming home to our own, we were that comfortable. After this experience, we are planning more trips to NYC (Website hidden by Airbnb) "
1694,6090,161874,1/2/11,195883,Pete,"Our stay at Alina's for Christmas 2010 was everything we wanted it to be.Being our first experience on Airbnb we were slightly nervous, but the entire stay went without a hitch. We were in New York for Christmas and New Year, and this was made all the better by having a nice, clean apartment in a good location to return home to at night. The subway (2 stations) are within 5 minutes walk, and we recommend Washington Square diner for a great breakfast to start your day.Collecting and dropping off keys was simple, the internet is very fast and reliable, and there was even a new flat screen TV which we weren't expecting. Alina was easy to contact both before and during our stay, and even purchased some tickets on our behalf for the New York Knicks, helping to make our holiday all the better by going above and beyond her duties as out host. Thank you!The only drawback is lugging 2 suitcases up 5 flights of stairs, but you only do this twice, and isn't too bad.Couldn't ask for more."

I preferred to stay downtown exploring the village, East Village, SoHo and NoHo. The apartment is well decorated and has everything you need. Thought has been given to the smaller details and Alina went as far as a welcome card and flowers. This was really special after travelling such as distance. Really clean with extra linen and towels provided made it easy. Alina also went out of her way to provide details of local services. "

Alina e' stata molto gentile e di aiuto,per qualsiasi mia domanda  e veloce nel rispondere a tutte le mie domande.consiglio vivamente questo appartamento.bellissima esperienza."
1701,6090,131558391,2/12/17,51140641,Lori,"Apartment is in a fabulous location. Guests should be prepared for consistent street noise and the fact that this apartment is a walk up involving several flights of stairs. Also, the building is pre-war, which means there is an older, somewhat loud radiator for heat. Plenty of blankets and towels were provided, as well as some handy items like a space heater. Given the items already in the apartment, space is fairly limited for the belongings of guests who may be staying for longer periods. The host was responsive about answering questions and concerns. "
1702,6090,140727540,3/31/17,35952808,Diana,Great place
1703,6090,156642985,5/31/17,23758404,Steve,"The location is terrific. The Village really is a village and you can have an uncommonly quiet and intimate experience in this neighborhood. You will find 'favorite' places; innumerable restaurants and shops, as well as easy access to transportation. It is an apartment that looks onto Bleecker Street so there is noise! I tuned it out and slept well there. It is a clean and efficient apartment without a lot of frills and that suited me just fine!"
1704,6090,185024240,8/20/17,20522230,Neil,Beautiful apartment in an absolutely perfect location in the West Village. Alina was very responsive when needed or just needed questions answered. Apartment is well appointed and is a great place for a long term stay. Highly recommended.
1705,6090,195757960,9/20/17,122798620,Grace,I can't recommend this place & host enough! Perfect location on a main street however still a quiet feeling. Close to everything you need amongst a popular neighbourhood. Alina was a good communicator and very accommodating. You will love your stay here!

1707,6090,218710224,12/14/17,39677048,Alex,"Great place. An old building adds extra charm. The best, though, is the area. Alina was very responsive."
1708,6090,232356203,2/4/18,4662581,Murray,"Alinaâ€™s place is fantastic. Great location and the nice end of the street. Close to everything! Itâ€™s quite spacious for what it is and well maintained. Itâ€™s on the 5th floor with no lift. No problem for me, but some might not like this. Iâ€™ll stay again if I can. "
1709,6090,283778178,6/30/18,59688996,Rahel,"I lived in Alina's apartment for a few months and it was a perfect fit for me. As I explored New York I really felt I was living in the best location - clean, quiet and chic. The apartment was just as photographed  and had a great  energy  as soon as I arrived. Alina was such a great host.  I always felt comfortable contacting her with any questions I had and she always got back to me ASAP. I really felt at home in her apartment and was sad to leave it.  I look forward to staying there again in the future!"
1710,6090,302445546,8/5/18,153169247,Dan,"Alina's apartment was spacious, clean, and in a great location -- just as advertised! Alina is responsive and considerate host. You won't regret staying here!"
1711,6848,3149,5/25/09,18003,Ken,"Stayed with Allen and Irina about a year ago. The apartment was more spacious than we thought it would be. They were helpful and nice when we needed that, and left us alone when we needed that too. The location is pretty good, not that far a walk into Williamsburg/hipsterville, and not that far into Manhattan either. We enjoyed our stay!"
1712,6848,3287,5/29/09,16426,Mimi,"Irina was very welcoming and the apt was comfortable and felt very homely and clean. We had an amazing time in NY and hope to visit again, Thank you Mimi & Neale"
1713,6848,3687,6/7/09,18432,Alice,"This apartment was perfect for our stay in NY this past weekend. Very comfortable, easy parking, and very gracious hosts. Thank you so much! I'm sure we'll be back. "
1714,6848,3987,6/14/09,8646,Mike,"Allen and Irena were simply wonderful hosts and great ambassadors to New York and Brooklyn.   They let us keep our bags in the apartment before check-in and were very easy to communicate with.    They provided us with a map of the area with local stuff like laundry, restaurants, etc.   The apartment itself was very spacious as far as New York goes -- a room that size would normally be hundreds of dollars a night.   Very close to trains and within a mile of Bedford Ave.   Just a really nice place and really nice people.   Thanks so much.  Highly recommended.  "
1715,6848,5228,7/8/09,17311,Megan,"It's everything Mike M said & more. Allen & Irina are such great people, it felt more like staying with friends than renting a room from strangers. The kitchen has whatever you might need to cook your own meals (but there are too many great places to eat out at that it's a challenge to try to do so). The breakfast goodies provided in the fridge were great & helped us start our day earlier so we could keep exploring. The location was perfect. My friends were skeptical when I said I was staying in Brooklyn to visit NYC, but it was so quick & easy to get to Manhattan every day. I also felt safe coming home late at night. I wouldn't have done anything differently, except book a longer vacation!"
1716,6848,5624,7/16/09,20347,Will,"Great place, friendly people, had everything we needed and more! Thanks Irina and Allen :)"
1717,6848,5947,7/22/09,22786,Jeff,"The basics: Clean, nice, home-away-from-home feeling.  Safe neighborhood, few-frills but many comforts way to visit NYC. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.  Details on my experience: This was my first time using AirBnB, and I thought that it was a great experience.  I've already recommended the site to many friends, and will use it again. My sister's family used it simultaneously, and my brother and I stayed at Allen and Irina's place while she stayed at one of the Hotel Toshi properties.  We were both very happy with our stays, but I think that I got the better deal.Allen and Irina were *extremely* proactive communicators, confirming dates and arrival times and printing out neighborhood maps with recommended restaurants.  Allen had a parking space right outside the front door, which he gave to me for unloading (my initial spot was 1.5 blocks away - safe, free parking is easily found nearby).  Both were very concerned about making sure we had everything we wanted, and freely offered info, but they never felt intrusive. Helpful, friendly and truly concerned with ensuring we enjoyed ourselves - some of the best customer service ever!The place itself was really nice. Brooklyn on somewhat of a budget nice, not W hotel nice, but I liked it better than my stay at the Waldorf Astoria several years back. Bigger rooms, fridge and pantry spare but stocked with breakfast essentials, bathroom built for tall people (I'm 6'2"" and my brother is 6'4"" and neither of us had to do the usual ducking for showerheads or sink mirror).  Also, they provided way more clean towels, blankets, etc than we might ever need, and everything looked and felt very clean. Seriously, getting this space at this price was great!The negatives:Our last night there, wireless internet went out.  Out of their control, as they lost their residential phone, internet & cable upstairs (as usual, TWC sucks) and they obviously wanted it fixed more than we did.  The TV in the room (as I saw in the photos) was a very small oldschool TV/VCR combo - not a problem for me but perhaps for others.  The apartment is obviously furnished by people rather than by IKEA, which I prefer but some may not like.  Overall, I'm glad we stayed here rather than one of the Hotel Toshi properties, which have nicer stuff (big flatscreen TV's, ultramodern furnishings) but require dealing with a more corporate machine type of customer service (separate building for check-in, sub-par customer service, maids rushing you to leave so they can clean, etc).  Anyone wishing to contact me for more details is welcome to do so.  Thanks Allen and Irina!"
1718,6848,6193,7/27/09,22455,Celeste,"Good deal for Brooklyn. Clean, AC, Irina let us arrive early in the morning after an overnight flight. Overall recommended"
1719,6848,6664,8/3/09,26517,Manya,"The place was perfect for my birthday weekend. I've lived in Manhattan and wanted to explore Brooklyn and everything that interested me was proximate and easy (and it would have been a breeze to see Manhattan from this location as well.) The amenities themselves were wonderful (I was won over when I saw my favorite hair dryer in the bathroom, but the bed was comfy, the rooms were spacious, the place was overall a phenomenal deal.) I hope I left everything clean enough because I'd be delighted to stay again! Thanks!"
1720,6848,12717,10/7/09,30985,Eyal And Vered,"We stayed 3 nights with our two kids (13 and 17). the place is very warm and comfort, and so are Irina and Allen."

1722,6848,19286,12/6/09,44462,Lydia & Jacques,"We stayed only a (too) short weekend. It was really nice. This was our first experience with airbnb and I can just tell everyone, that it was awesome.The place was so cozy and we felt at home immediately. It had all we needed. I would even recommend this place for more than 2 people, if you are ok with sharing a place. Irina was a really nice host. She opened the door with a big smile and showed us everything. It is only a short walk to a lot of restaurants and bars and you are in Manhattan very quickly using the Subway. Thank you very much, Irina."
1723,6848,23837,1/11/10,24256,Rachel,"Loved the location and the apartment was clean and tidy and a perfect size for the two of us.  Irina was a great host, leaving us with essentials when we first arrived.  Would definetely recommend the apartment."
1724,6848,26620,2/17/10,65178,Jeanine,"We had a great stay. We accidentally arrived a little early, but Irina was very accommodating. The place was clean, plenty of sheets and blankets, even OJ in the fridge. We didn't meet Allen, but Irina couldn't have been more helpful."
1725,6848,42672,5/15/10,119449,Tiffany,The apartment was wonderfully furnished and very well stocked. The location couldn't have been better for us and Irina & Allen were easy to communicate with and were very accommodating.

1730,6848,2425876,9/27/12,535321,Carol,We love New York! This was our 8th trip and we were very comfortable. Our daughter lives in Brooklyn so this was perfect for us. Irina and Allen were great hosts and it's a great apartment. We look forward to returning next year. Dick & Carol McGrane
1731,6848,2820079,11/5/12,278240,Reid,"Allen and Irina were very responsive, extremely friendly and such a pleasure to deal with.  The apartment is clean and in great condition.  Overall, the experience could not have been any better."
1732,6848,3414801,1/26/13,19967,Tea,"I stayed at Allen and Irinas apartment with my boyfriend and his 9 year old daughter. We were happy to stay there. It fit perfectly for the three of us and was nice and very clean! We enjoyed the free netflix account at night. The apartment is close to the subway and several restaurants and cafes are located around the corner. I can definately recommend staying there!"
1733,6848,3560276,2/17/13,3575142,Loes,"Nice appartment close to two different metro stops, so easy acces to Manhattan. But Williamsburg is a nice neighbourhood as well, with some very nice restaurants and shops. Irina was very helpfull when we arrived. The appartment has a nice bathroom and a very comfortable bed! "
1734,6848,4744028,5/23/13,5471074,Emma,"Excellent apartment! Ground level... Which makes life easy. Safe. Close to 3 subways. The place had lots of nice products and lotions and a hair dryer. Irina showed us everything, gave us keys and then let us enjoy our stay. Very clean. 3 of us stayed. Good times!"
1735,6848,5214040,6/18/13,2773722,Nick,"Great apartment in a great area. Easy to check in/check out, I definitely recommend."
1736,6848,7638798,9/28/13,1645731,Mikael,"Pros: Pretty nice, clean and spacious apartment in a good area. 3 different subways, all within 5 minutes walk. IMO, this part of Williamsburg is actually better than around the Bedford ave stop, which sometimes feels like a hipster circus. This area is more relaxed but still with lots of good restaurants and bars. And perfectly safe. Well-equipped kitchen. Allen and Irina let us store our bags in their shed after checkout, which was very convenient since we had a couple of hours to kill before our flight. Cons: The apartment is pretty dark. It's on ground level. You will hear street noises very clearly (this street is surprisingly quiet for NYC though). As far as we could make out, the TV reception was pretty bad, but we didn't come to New York to watch TV so we didn't really try to figure out if it could be made better. All in all, we had a positive experience. Good value for money. "
1737,6848,8020090,10/13/13,344028,Jorge,"Everything as published. The location is good, you are a few metro stops away from Manhattan. The neighborhood is not so nice, but, for example, if you're gonna stay in upper west-side Manhattan, is exactly the same.Forget about TV, the satellite service doesn't work.Is a ground-level apartment, but is in a very quiet area. We sleep very well.The best: the space (is huge!), the kitchen (away from the living-bedroom area), the location.The worst: very dark, forget to be there without AC, TV service (but who needs TV in NYC!).Is recommendable if you're gonna be in the street all day and just coming back to eat-sleep."
1738,6848,8651923,11/11/13,4354542,Nathan,"Allen and Irina were great hosts, both of them met us when we arrived and gave us the house rules, Irina showed us how to work the TV and used her ""nose like a bloodhound"" to help fix the oven. They were really nice and cheery and instantly made us feel welcome. We needn't have brought any guidebooks as the basket on the table had plenty to choose from.The apartment itself was really nice, it had a lovely homely feel and was surprisingly large, way more than enough room for 2. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the bathroom was great too. Another upside was that the apartment was always lovely and warm whenever we returned from our travels. Unfortunately we didn't get to try out the kitchen beyond using a glass or two (one of the downsides of eating out every night haha) but everything looked in working order.The location of the apartment was brilliant. In a safe area that's just a walk away from Bedford Avenue and all manner of Restaurants, CafÃ©s, Bars and Delis. There is definitely a lot to do near the apartment. It is also incredibly easy to travel into Manhattan via the L train only a few minutes walk away.We would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking to visit New York. It is a great place to stay with amazing transport links and brilliant hosts."
1739,6848,8868380,11/23/13,8855690,Anna,"Place was great, good location and very homely. Allen & Irina were helpfully and welcoming. "
1740,6848,9050327,12/3/13,45181,Marie,"We had a wonderful stay. The apartment is very clean and had everything we needed. The host was friendly and easy to deal with. Check in was easy and it worked for us to leave our bags there past check out time as we had a later flight. This gave us time for one more quick trip into Manhattan and some shopping at a Christmas market. WiFi worked very well and was important for us to have. The soundproofing in the building is very minimal, but luckily the street out front was very quiet all weekend. We had no problem sleeping, even sleeping in quite late. Would defiantly stay here again and hope to next Thanksgiving weekend!"
1741,6848,9098372,12/7/13,5233232,Marlen,"Das Apartment ist sehr gemÃ_tlich, sauber und gut angebunden. In unmittelbarer NÃ_he befinden sich diverse Delis, Diner und Restaurants.

1742,6848,9260904,12/16/13,10537833,Hugo,"Clean, tidy, warm and easy to get to. A very good option if you want to be in Brooklyn and near a subway for quick access to Manhattan. It would be a bit dark if you wanted to spend any time indoors during the day, but near perfect as a place to sleep and shower at. "
1743,6848,9362229,12/24/13,3548203,Joanne,"Allen and Irina's place was a nice little getaway from Manhattan, and, as other reviews have said, it's a quick train ride into the city. The place was a great size and set up for two people and included a great internet connection (a minimum requirement for me) with access to Netflix and basic TV for the times not exploring the area. The windows were right on the street, which could get a bit noisy especially on the warmer evenings when people were out socializing in the neighborhood, but if you've worn yourself out sightseeing, you can easily block this out. Communication was great, the place was clean and stores to stock up on food were close by. An enjoyable stay. "
1744,6848,11017020,3/17/14,11244543,Gianna,We very much enjoyed our stay at Allen and Irina's convenient Williamsburg home. The bottom story studio was welcoming and very warm (handy as it was bitter cold outside!) Irina was friendly and provided us with some local knowledge.

1747,6848,12775690,5/11/14,9123330,Kai,Wir wurden von Irina sehr freundlich empfangen und haben uns in ihrem Studio sofort wohl gefÃ_hlt. Es ist alles sehr sauber und Bett und Schlafcouch waren sehr gemÃ_tlich. FÃ_r 3 Leute ist das Studio auf jeden Fall groÃŸ genug. Uns hat Williamsburg super gut gefallen und man erreicht Manhatten schnell und problemlos mit der Metro. Irina konnte uns gute Tips geben und war super hilfsbereit. Das GebÃ_ude ist etwas hellhÃ¶rig.
1748,6848,61336983,2/2/16,50451071,Keith,Irina & Allen were amazing hosts - very attentive and easy going.  The apartment was as listed and very convenient for all of our needs.  
1749,6848,62253595,2/13/16,23082983,Zoe,"We loved our stay here. The room was clean, more spacious than the photos indicated, very warm and the bed was amazingly comfortable. We had all the creature comforts of home with a well stocked kitchen and extra blankets and towels stowed conveniently in the cupboard. The location is also great with it being close to many of the train stations and positioned in what felt like the outskirts of Williamsburg. It's not right in the thick of Williamsburg, but we liked that as it meant we were more likely to explore some of the other cool areas nearby, like Green Point and Brooklyn Heights. But in terms of walking distance, it is most closely located to the main part of Williamsburg than anywhere else and was a very easy walk to the main streets. In terms of the hosts, Allen and Irina, we found them to be hands-off but ready and there to help us when we needed them - so this suited us perfectly as we liked having our autonomy during our stay. Irina welcomed us when we first arrived and was very flexible with accommodating our arrival time that had shifted slightly. She also helped with printing some tickets for us while we were there and let us store our luggage in an adjoining shed after check-out - which was super appreciated as we weren't flying out until the evening! The only small point of feedback we have is that on one occasion we could not get the key to work in the door so we had to ring the bell to get back into the room. Allen came down to let us in but wasn't very friendly with us. It was after 10am in the morning and we hadn't lost the key, we just couldn't get it to work in the door, so we felt a bit put off by the manner we were met with. With everything said, this place is clean, cozy, homely and well located for those wanting to explore the many areas of Brooklyn. We would definitely recommend for others to stay here."
1750,6848,62721500,2/16/16,15045414,Colin,"Allen & Irina's place is in a great location in Williamsburg and was perfect for a weekend trip split between Manhattan and Brooklyn. The bed was king size and comfortable, and the kitchen was well-furnished. The apartment was nice and warm for a chilly weekend in New York and the street is relatively quiet street. The hosts left us with everything that we needed and let us make it our home for the weekend. "

The location in Williamsburg is very central,  near both the M and L trains. Very close to Manhattan but also great places in Williamsburg. We were walking distance to a great breakfast place named Otha's and many other little bodegas. We were also very close to Bedford avenue, where we went to some great restaurants and stores. I'd love to stay here next time we visit !"

It's an easy 20min walk into the main area of Williamsburg. Certainly made for a quieter stay after a week in Manhattan. The king size bed was a real treat, so beautifully made as well. There is a great bike shop in the next street - $25 for 4 hours, a great way to see your surrounds. Allen and irina were prompt with communication and accommodated our luggage after check out. "

1766,6848,91117865,8/3/16,59316325,Sung Yoon,This place has everything you need. The room was spacious and the bed was large and confortable. In the kitchen you can see the variety of tools and plates. Every morning we had great breakfast here. Irine was helful while we were staying. She also kindly lent us an umbrella when it rained. I liked the place.
1767,6848,92310128,8/8/16,8871977,Trish,"This was everything we needed! It was right around the corner from where our friend lives, and was beautifully large, clean, and so super comfortable. We were so happy to rest our heads here after a long day of walking all over NYC. Thank you guys so much for your hospitality. We will definitely be back again next year!"
1768,6848,92659022,8/9/16,4365196,Andrea,"Irina was responsive to all our communications. She met us upon arrival, showed us around the apartment, and offered to be available if we needed anything. The apartment is spacious, well equipped, spotlessly clean and very comfortable, especially the wonderful king bed. Surprisingly quiet too! "
1769,6848,94078327,8/14/16,84112401,Josef,"We loved our time at Allen & Irina's place! It was really clean, bright and in a fantastic location. We met Irina on arrival, and she was very welcoming and happy to host us. They were especially accommodating to us, considering our flight was delayed several hours and arrived around midnight. The bed in this place is magnificent - very soft, and warm! The full kitchen is really nice, and is was great to see the dishwasher and clothes washer, even though we didn't use them. We recommend this place to anyone who needs a place to stay in Williamsburg. We will certainly look to Allen & Irina the next time we plan a trip to the area."
1770,6848,96150190,8/21/16,16562048,John,"Stayed here for five days with my girlfriend. We arrived late at night from the airport as our luggage was lost, but the kind host patiently waited for us! Pros: The apartment is centrally located in Williamsburg and is big and comfortable for two people. Cons: very noisy."
1771,6848,97896215,8/28/16,83337607,Maija,"Allen and Irina's place was clean and comfortable. The apartment was secure behind the cutest orange door on the block!  Neighborhood felt safe and was within walking distance to restaurants, grocery, and pharmacy. We definitely enjoyed our stay here, felt like a home away from home!"
1772,6848,100174651,9/7/16,23384809,Sonja,"Das Studio hat eine tolle Lage und ist fÃ_r New Yorker VerhÃ_ltnisse wirklich sehr groÃŸzÃ_gig. Die groÃŸe KÃ_che ist sehr modern und vollstÃ_ndig ausgerÃ_stet, wir haben sie allerdings gar nicht genutzt. Auch das Bad ist sehr gerÃ_umig. Was aus dem Inserat und den Bildern nicht hervorgeht, ist dass es sich quasi um ein Souterrain-Apartment handelt, daher also trotz voller Beleuchtung deutlich dunkler ist. Dadurch wirkt auch die grÃ¶ÃŸtenteils ""klassische"" Ausstattung weniger modern als auf den Bildern, was uns zu Beginn etwas enttÃ_uscht hat. Aber wenn man wie wir sowieso nur zum Schlafen im Studio ist, ist das auch schnell wieder egal. Das riesige Bett ist dafÃ_r nÃ_mlich unglaublich bequem. Trotzdem in jedem Fall OhrstÃ¶psel mitnehmen, da es recht hellhÃ¶rig ist.Alles in allem hatten wir einen tollen Aufenthalt im Apartment."
1773,6848,100491686,9/9/16,41480816,Amy,"Irina was very friendly and cordial and provided a tour of the apartment on arrival.  I arrived many hours before check in and she allowed me to drop off my bags at the apartment which made it easier for me to go out into the city.  She offered a great suggestion for a nearby cafe for me to visit as well.  The apartment was very clean and cozy.  The neighborhood felt safe, and I saw lots of young adults as well as families walking around the area.  There was a little construction happening on the street at the time of my stay, but obviously out of the hosts control.  I would absolutely stay here again and look forward to returning. "
1774,6848,102119641,9/16/16,68904037,Nick,"We loved staying here. Irina was really welcoming and helpful (we were particularly grateful that she let us leave our bags in the apartment after checkout on the final day, as our flight home was late afternoon).  The apartment was very comfortable - clean, spacious and homely. It was great to have Netflix for when we returned after a long day of sightseeing! The apartment was ideally situated for us - close to the subway and with lots of great places to eat and drink within walking distance. We would definitely stay there again. Thank you very much!"
1775,6848,103254498,9/21/16,79261900,Christine,"Irina war immer sehr gut zu erreichen â€“ die Anreise/Abreise und â€_Check In/Outâ€œ haben reibungslos funktioniert.Das Appartement war sehr sauber und gerÃ_umig. In der KÃ_che war alles vorhanden, um gut zu frÃ_hstÃ_cken.Die Anbindung an Manhattan ist wirklich sehr gut â€“ es sind nur ein paar Minuten bis zur nÃ_chsten Metro (Hewes St), die direkt Ã_ber die Williamsburg Bridge nach Manhattan fÃ_hrt. Williamsburg selbst kann man gut zu FuÃŸ erkunden."
1776,6848,103893082,9/24/16,9718386,Caroline,This is a great base for enjoying both Manhattan and Brooklyn. It's easy to get in to Manhattan on a couple of metro lines and it's nice to return at the end of the day to a comfy apartment in a neighbourhood rather than a tiny hotel room in Manhattan. The bed was extremely comfortable and we had great sleep each night despite a bit of noise from outside and above. The apartment was nice and clean and well equipped and the shower was good. Overall a very good choice.  
1777,6848,104425451,9/26/16,6194000,Elisha,"My stay was nice, the apartment had all of the amenities necessary for a stay -- and the bed was really comfortable. My only slight complaint is that the photos make the place look a lot brighter than it actually is -- it's a basement property so it was often quite dark, even with the lights on. Besides that, Irina was lovely and the apartment is in a great location for exploring Brooklyn and quickly getting into Manhattan. I would highly recommend staying here. "
1778,6848,110575959,10/27/16,67748097,Mathieu,"Great place to stay in brooklyn. The appartement is very close from subway, it s spacious and bed is amazing ..Irina answers to your questions if you need it. Only one thing it s a little bit dark and noisy sometimes.."
1779,6848,113052632,11/9/16,44998575,Zoe,"Great location, great small apartment with large well equipped kitchen.  Noise levels a little high; could hear their parrot and outside as on ground level and poorly lit, but it was perfect for trip, comfortable and very clean."
1780,6848,114938531,11/20/16,60569482,Pamela,"Fantastic apartment with loads of space and convenience. The bed is heaven. Occasionally noisy and the wifi can be patchy but it's the perfect location to explore the city from, or to take a stroll in Williamsburg. "
1781,6848,116600079,12/1/16,18284518,Eve,"We really enjoyed our stay at Allen and Irina's apartment. Brooklyn is a wonderful area to explore on it own with lots of restaurants within walking distance. Very close to Metropolitan avenue station G and L lines as well as the J and M lines at Hewes St station (the latter particularly useful for connecting with the JFK airtrain) and the Q54 bus so the apartment is very easy to get to without having to use a taxi. There is everything in the apartment that you could possibly need including a dishwasher and all the kitchen accoutrements and the bed is super comfy. We loved our stay and found Irina and Allen to be great hosts. Oh and for any fellow Australian visitors who love their espresso, excellent Australian style coffee can be found within walking distance (1km) at Sweatshop cafe in metropolitan avenue. "
1782,6848,145682484,4/19/17,63661804,Maedhbh,"The apartment was very comfortable and it felt like our own home for 10 days! It is very well equipped with everything you need in the kitchen and plenty of linens and towels with extra pillows and blankets. The location is ideal for browsing Brooklyn or going to Manhattan. The subway is a short walk for the L train to Manhattan. The area has grocery stores, laundry, coffee shops, restaraunts, bars all within walking distance. Walk to Greenpoint and Williamsburg central or get the train to Fort Greene for further taste of Brooklyn - have a drink, a bite to eat, get your nails done, visit a book shop, work out in the park or sit and watch the world go by! The apartment has a real Brooklyn feel - the parrot upstairs chirping and the occasional street noise just added to the authentic  experience. We would love to return so One!"
1783,6848,147239141,4/25/17,117555992,Brad,Everything was great. Close to manhattan and a lot of cool places in Brooklyn but still quiet 
1784,6848,153920028,5/22/17,113683090,Christoph,"Das Appartment und seine Lage eignet sich wirklich um NY zu erkunden. Die KÃ_che ist sehr gut ausgestattet bietet sehr viel Platz. Das groÃŸe Bett ist fÃ_r 2 Personen gut ausreichend und sehr bequem. Das ausziehbare Sofa bietet ebenfalls Platz fÃ_r 2 weitere Personen, hat aber seine besten Tage hinter sich und die Matratze ist etwas durchgelegen und unbequem. Ansonste alles top."
1785,6848,160107243,6/12/17,58259189,Francisco,The place is very close to the L train. Very good location.  Our flight came in late but Irina waited for us late to welcome us to the room.  Thank You ! 
1786,6848,168781185,7/10/17,41441976,Caddy,"Allen and Irina's studio was a great place to stay in Williamsburg. Walking was no problem to different subway lines as well as being clean and tidy, we couldn't ask for a better place to enjoy our stay in Brooklyn! Thank you :) "
1787,6848,170431763,7/15/17,78609183,Kate,"Irina was an excellent host. She communicated well at all times.The apartment had everything that I needed and a very comfortable king-sized bed.I felt safe walking around the neighborhood. The apartment was close to the subway and to some wonderful coffee houses like Mountain Province."
1788,6848,172032031,7/19/17,5126651,Georgia,Allen and Irina are very responsive and we had a lovely time in their apartment. It's a great place to stay and super easy to get into Manhattan on the subway. The kitchen is fabulous if you want to cook as it has everything you could need! 
1789,6848,180535435,8/10/17,5043403,Shaun,"Irina was very flexible with our arrival, since we had a few delays coming from the airport. She greeted us warmly and showed us around. Our stay was so short, so we weren't able to make use of the kitchen, which was quite big relative to the apartment. Ground floor made for easy in and out, plus the AC was a savior on warm evenings. Thanks a ton!"
1790,6848,184425026,8/19/17,26996094,Noam,Spacious and very well equipped
1791,6848,191480489,9/7/17,3996988,Maxime,"TrÃ¨s bel emplacement. Williamsburg est un quartier trÃ¨s sympathique qui vaut largement le dÃ©tour. Appartement Ã  5 min du mÃ©tro qui vous emmÃ¨ne trÃ¨s rapidement Ã  Manhattan.Appart trÃ¨s clean et trÃ¨s bien Ã©quipÃ©.C'Ã©tait parfait !"
1792,6848,194262962,9/16/17,15026043,Kat,"The apartment could really use updating and some new bath towels. The lighting isn't good especially in the bathroom (good luck putting on make up). The curtain shears do nothing to keep out the morning sun, so you can forget sleeping in. There is a new building going in directly behind the apartment so the noise is just starting. There isn't regular TV, just something like Hulu and Netflix. The host wasn't very helpful. We ran out of toilet paper 7 days into a 10 day stay and felt like we put the host out when we requested additional rolls. I won't recommend this location to anyone."
1793,6848,203159295,10/14/17,13269115,Patrizia,"Buona posizione ben servita dalla metropolitana ed ai supermercati Casa pulitaHost molto disponibile e simpatico Ubicato al piano terra con poca luce"
1794,6848,216912542,12/6/17,16767305,Renea,It has a grat location. Metro just 5 minutes away and you are in 15 minutes in Manhatten.

1796,6848,238303513,2/25/18,2536162,Angelica,Great location! The apartment does not get much natural light but it was clean and comfortable. Irina was responsive and very accommodating.

1798,6848,242900147,3/13/18,1223602,Nadine,"Sweet, cozy space. Clean, quiet, near subway. We slept really well after roaming around all day. We didn't see much of our hosts, but they seemed friendly and accommodating when we needed to drop our bag off before check-in time. And responsive via email when we couldn't figure out how to use the TV."
1799,6848,245076972,3/20/18,19827975,Rachel,"The apartment is clean, and stylish and made a lovely home for the week we stayed there. The location is also great - 5 minute walk from the subway through what felt like a very safe area and with a great diner on the walk home!"
1800,6848,245488628,3/22/18,63878754,Stuart,"We chose this place based on photos, location, and price and were happy with the location but were surprised by the difference between the photos and what the place actually looks like. It has everything shown in the photos, but is not as nice as it looks. The furniture smells musty and and old and worn so it takes a minute to take it in. The kitchen is fully equipped and has a washer machine.  The price was right until we paid and realized the cleaning fee is as much as an extra night stay (we are from the area and use a reputable cleaning service that is less than half that price). The main issue was unfortunately the hosts. When we arrived there was a long silence and we had to start asking questions to try to figure out the basics- where are the keys? What is the wifi? etc. We were told the locks were funny but weren't shown how to work them until we couldn't lock the door and were locked out. A positive note: they do have netflix they allowed us to use!The noise was pretty bad- the hosts live in the apartment upstairs and seem to own a bird that was periodically making noise. Footsteps and bangs were constant. On our last night stay we were awoken by loud banging that sounded like someone throwing something down the stairs that started at 6am and lasted about a half an hour."
1801,6848,248048694,3/30/18,129236136,Lukasz,"Die Wohnung ist nah an den Stationen Hewes Street, Broadway und Metropolitan Avenue. Vom Flughafen erreicht man die Wohnung auch sehr gut mit der Bahn (AirTrain nach Jamaica und dann die Bahn zur Hewes Street). Die Grand Street und die Bedford Avenue, hier sind viele Bars, Restaurants und EinkaufsmÃ¶glichkeiten in Williamsburg, sind fuÃŸlÃ_ufig erreichbar.  Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber gewesen und war gut ausgestattet. Allen und Irina wohnen im Obergeschoss. Check In und Check Out verliefen problemlos. Wie konnten auch nach dem Check Out unsere Koffer da lassen, da wir erst spÃ_ter geflogen sind. Wir wÃ_rden ein weiteres mal die Wohnung von Allen und Irina buchen!"

Host provided every convenience including towels, soap, shampoo etc People sensitive to noise will hear emergency vehicle sirens and street noise from time to time as the windows are not very thick - but that's Brooklyn!"
1803,6848,258627791,4/29/18,8236290,Laura,"We had a really nice time in Irina & Allens apartment during our 10-day-stay in Williamsburg. They were very kind and flexible about the check-in and check-out. The apartment is everything you need for a city trip with a lot of restaurants, bars and several metro stations close by. Thanks again. We would definitely stay again!"
1804,6848,263660202,5/12/18,7223755,Camille,"We had a great stay at Irina's place. The place is really comfortable and cozy, close to the subway and in a very nice neighbourhood (really good restaurant and coffees!). The place is very spacious for 2 people. The only downside : I wouldn't recommend it for light sleepers, the noise insulation between the apartment and the one above isn't really good, so we were sometimes woken up by the noise from upstairs. We used earplugs and it was ok. So altogether we had a really good stay so we would recommend this place!"

1811,6848,312475900,8/23/18,21217909,Christopher,"Irina welcomed us personally at her apartment. The apartment itself was   Cozy and well equipped (it was luxury to have a washing machine and a dish washer).The huge bed was fantastic as well and much larger than expected.We where as well welcomed by a basket with traveling guides and even a multiple-function-adapter. We greatly enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend vacations here to visit New York City. Williamsburg is quite enough at night for some good hours of sleep and near enough to Manhattan to get to  the many sightseeingâ€™s and places quickly. Williamsburg itself has some really nice restaurants and bars which are worth visiting as well"
1812,6848,314980302,8/27/18,27637219,Kim,"We spent 4 days in Brooklyn at Allen and Irina's place.  Location is perfect for exploring NYC.  Obviously Brooklyn is at your doorstep, but also a quick subway ride to Manhatten.   Lot's of fun restaurants, bars and bodegas right outside your door, lots within a quick 5 minute walk.  There is definitely some street noise, but that comes from being in the city.  It didn't bother us and we are usually sensitive to noise.  Nice having a king sized bed and it was also really comfortable!  We would definitely recommend staying here, particularly if you are looking to stay in Williamsburg."
1813,6848,319532967,9/6/18,98530528,Maria,The only orange door around the neighborhood. Irina came to meet us when we arrive and showed us around the apartment. The house was tidy and fully furnished which also gave us a chance to cook.. She has been very helpful in answering our queries. Would love to have the place again in case weâ€™ll be around the neighborhood. It is also few minutes walk to the subway.

In many ways i thought the place was a work of art in itself.  The bed was also very comfortable.  Cynthia went out of her way to be both a helpful and welcoming host and she cooked some fantastic and healthy meals. The area is also great for shopping and food.  My stay at Cynthia's was a very pleasant, comfortable and enjoyable experience."
1817,6990,17107,11/13/09,46566,Maggie,"Cynthia's apartment was absolutely beautiful. It is definitely a work of art and reminiscient of a life-size doll's house. It is in a lovely, quiet location, and just one block from the 6 train an buses, which take you pretty much anywhere you want to go. I stayed here with 5 other girls and although there was a good amount of space, it got messy very quickly, so I would definitely recommend a smaller group. Especially because Cynthia likes to keep the place meticulous at all times - and rightly so! She was a very good host and kind enough to show us around the neighbourhood on our arrival. Staying here definitely enhanced our fabulous NYC experience!"
1818,6990,18055,11/22/09,53723,Michelle,"Cynthia was an amazing host- You will love her place, it is beautiful! She made us a delicious, healthy breakfast.

1820,6990,19236,12/5/09,58403,Michael,"What can I say about Cynthia?We stayed at her apartment for 3 nights & it was fantastic. I booked it at very short notice and was slightly worried as I was travelling with my 11 year old daughter and hadn't been to NY for 20 years but I had nothing to worry about, Cynthia went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and happy. She is the perfect hostess & we felt we were staying with family than renting a place.The apartment is amazing & oozes style. The location is great with Central Park a few blocks away & the Subway round the corner. Thank you Cynthia it was a real pleasure to meet you & you made our NY experience a lot more pleasurable. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this apartment hope to return again soon! :)"
1821,6990,19408,12/6/09,58318,Kate,"This worked out just perfectly for our quick weekend in NYC. With free parking on the street and the train just a block away, we were able to get around quickly and easily, and Cynthia's place is gorgeous, clean, and comfortable. She's an artist whose stunning work is everywhere in the apartment, and we loved hearing about her work, too."
1822,6990,21128,12/22/09,34254,Christine,"absolutely the best experience I've ever had at Airbnb. Cynthia's place is AMAZING... it's spacious, impeccably clean, peaceful and a one of a kind artistic space. She has remodeled the space and added her artistic touches to just about every square inch-- and it's done very well. Additionally, Cynthia is a great host and goes out of her way to make sure your stay is the best it can be. The physical location of the place is also superb; half a block away there are restaurants and a CVS, one block away is the subway, grocery store, and specialty produce store. The neighborhood is safe, beautiful and residential with a mix of really good shopping and restaurants a walk away; no need to take cabs. Do yourself a favor and book here, you will certainly enjoy your stay."
1823,6990,22838,1/3/10,56291,Jon,"WE HAD A PERFFECT WEEK AT CYNTHIA'S PLACE. THE APARTAMENT IS REALLY CONFORTABLE, CLEAN, WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO MADE A LIVING, AND IN A GREAT LOCATION: TWO MINUTES TO SUBWAY, GROCERIES, PHARMACY... AND ALSO A GOOD PRICE. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR WITH CYNTHIA, SHE'S REALLY NICE AND HELPFUL. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE DEPOSIT, SHE INFORMED US ABOUT IT, AND HAD NO PROBLEM GETTIN IT BACK. THANKS CYNTHIA.  "
1824,6990,24881,1/26/10,60537,Nobutaka,"Letâ€™s be honest. As a spoiled child who is partial to 1982 ChÃ¢teau Margauxs and Nat Shermans, I enjoy the finer things in life. This usually means I stay at the Ritz Carlton and have grown accustomed to be waited on and cleaned up after. With that said, this was my first time using AirBnB and to be honest I was absolutely hesitant about â€œsharingâ€ù a room. Fortunately, I stumbled upon Cynthiaâ€™s listing and I was instantly intrigued. First of all, Cynthia offers the fairest rate out of all the Upper East Manhatten listings. Other people wanted to charge me twice or triple the amount for run down studios that I could have by myself or maybe share the place with a few cockroaches. Secondly, Cynthiaâ€™s apartment is akin to spending a few nights in a Lautner home. She has meticulously designed the bathrooms and the bedrooms so that you are constantly reminded that you are living in a piece of artwork. Finally, Cynthia was a fantastic and attentive host. She knows the city well and was constantly making sure that I was comfortable. (LA people beware: she thinks that walking fifty blocks is normal) I know for certain that if I ever find myself in the city of blinding lights again, I will stay with Cynthia or at the very least invite her out to dinner so that I can dispel her opinions with mine."
1825,6990,26870,2/19/10,78059,Hillary,"When experiencing a city as special as NY, its important to experience the people that make the city so special.  Cynthia's home is, in my opinion, the epitome of the spirit of New York.  She puts the same thought and consideration that goes into every piece of her artwork, into every space in her home, combining art and comfort, something that takes a lot of insight to create.  She is also so full of energy and life, so positive, which adds to the excitement of being in New York!  The location is perfect, a block from the 6 train, close to great shopping and restaurants.  She's very accommodating and easy going, a perfect host!  Thank you for everything, Cynthia!  I will be seeing you soon ;-)"
1826,6990,28418,3/6/10,76611,Alice,"Staying with Cynthia MADE our trip to New York City. Her house is AMAZING. She is AMAZING. And we had the most memorable time thanks to her. First of all, Cynthia's house is a work of art. All the rooms have the 'Cynthia' stamp. Waking up each morning in the beautiful rooms with the exposed brick walls, layers of velvet and contempory artwork masterpieces made us, my mother and I, feel like we were in a dream. The beds are oh so comfortable and Cynthia goes out of her way to make you feel right at home. Everything is meticulously clean and the bathroom is devine! Studying the carefully handcrafted mosaic mirror bathroom you will appreciate all the attention and love she has put into the apartment. I will miss her yummy healthy breakfasts and her warm smile. She is the best tour guide and shared with us the best places to eat, drink and shop like a local. I hope to only stay at Cynthia's when I am in New York City-my time with her was that enjoyable!!! Three days after leaving Cynthia's and I already am missing it!!"
1827,6990,30196,3/19/10,86302,Dennis,"Cynthia is just amazing. So helpfull, knows everything about NYC. A wonderful person. Staying with her is the best one can do. I love that girl.Dennis"
1828,6990,30882,3/22/10,90855,Lupe,"It was just like living in the city!  Close to everything, nice, clean, comfy and safe.The blue room isn't really that private because you share a window area with the red velvet room and  a sheer curtain with the living room.  The bathroom is amazing and a work of art but the door doesn't close all the way or lock.  I had a restful experience there.  Cynthia is the hostess with the mostest!"
1829,6990,32448,3/31/10,537,Miriam,"I had a fabulous stay with Cynthia. The house is a work of art in itself, and Cynthia was great company. The house is very near the subway so it's easy to get around. Don't hesitate to book!"
1830,6990,36010,4/17/10,71022,Helen,"Great area to stay in and very unique and artistic apartment.  Cynthia couldn't have been more kind to us.  We had the whole place to ourselves, but Cynthia was really helpful in recommending places to go, etc. When two of us found ourselves stranded in New York, Cynthia kindly offered to put us up, despite having another guest due. We didn't have to take her up on the offer, but we appreciated it very much. "
1831,6990,37386,4/23/10,96657,Paul,My stay with Cynthia was fantastic and made the NYC experience all the richer. A warm and comfortable retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. Cynthia is a generous host who provides a wealth of information and was great company. I could not recommend her and her apartment more highly.
1832,6990,39640,5/3/10,65608,Eduardo,"Cynthia`s apartment is a work of art. The place it`s cool, cosy, and extremely clean, a 5 star bed and breakfast located in a good&safe neighborhood surrounded by subway and bus lines, restaurants, antiques, groceries, bank offices, post office, and all sort of shops you can imagine.Besides all that (plus the fact that the Blue Room is fantastic), Cynthia herself should be considered a NYC must: her amazing company, joy of life and sense of humor will make your stay in NYC be anything less than remarkable (just like it was mine).in other words: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1833,6990,44514,5/21/10,78834,Victor,"I have had the privilege of staying with Cynthia at 97th street for two weeks during my first visit to NYC.It is no exaggeration to say that her home is by itself, a work of art. Every space is tastefully designed and furnished to combine aesthetic appeal with functionality. The blue room which I rented may appear rather small, but it has everything from a full length mirror, a closet, shelves, vanity top to a working space for the laptop! Cynthia also uses top quality sheets and linen which are extremely comfortable and clean.Cynthia herself is a delight as a housemate and host. During my stay, I felt more like a longtime friend rather than a short term guest, not once did it feel like a commercial rental arrangement. Cynthia is warm, accomodating and generous, willing to involve you in herday-to-day activities and events if you so wish. Everything is left as an open invitation, so you will not feel obliged if you already have other plans.Would recommend to any of my friends without hesitation.Good luck getting a reservation!

1835,6990,91704,9/7/10,105997,Susan,"Cynthia is delightful, and her home is incredibly creative and filled with art and architectural innovations. We unfortunately came at an extremely hot August time, and there wasn't adequate air conditioning. We would highly recommend a visit at any other time of year. Note that Cynthia tried hard to accommodate us with a fan, but we ended up having to move the final night when there would be 4 of us."
1836,6990,93471,9/8/10,201281,Mandy,"Staying with Cynthia was a pleasure. Her home is a work of art, spotless, beautiful and artistic. Not only was the setting perfect but Cynthia's friendliness and helpfulness went above and beyond. Nothing at all was too much trouble for her and she went beyond her role as host many times, I was apartment hunting during my stay and Cynthia asked her friends, looked online and did everything within her power to help me find somewhere. A wonderful woman, you would be lucky to stay in her home. "
1837,6990,98844,9/17/10,179030,Harriet,"Friendly and generous host. Convenient location for getting around NYC.  The apartment on E 97th is an artistic upgrade of a traditional NY apartment.  I think most people looking at this site would enjoy staying with Cynthia, and I certainly did."
1838,6990,103863,9/24/10,195427,Duane,Cynthia is a delightful and helpful hostess.  Staying there is like inhabiting a work or art.  One block to subway makes location convenient.

The place was conveniently located near my family so that was a big plus for me. Sharing a bathroom turned out to be OK, but the design of the bathroom sink made it hard to use so I used the kitchen sink instead. All in all, it was a nice place to stay for a few nights. "
1841,6990,127061,10/25/10,262363,Airlin,Cynthia is an amazing host and her home a beautiful piece of art. I was really impressed with how spotlessly clean the place is. This is without a doubt the best place for the price in all of Manhattan...and nicer I'm sure than most places twice the price.

1843,6990,135993,11/9/10,218826,Peter,"I don't know if i can praise the experience enough. It is my first time using AIRBNB as well as staying at a bed and breakfast, but I would not stay at a hotel room for my vacation anymore. The apartment is a work of art, Cynthia is a wonderful host, and location awesome. Walking distance to central park and museums there and even shorter walk to the metro. "

Her home is truly a work of art and credit to her for the hard work and creativity she has been able to adopt to her amazing home. I enjoyed being a part of her developments for a short time and look forward to a return visit. Her warmth, kindness and positive enthusiasm to life was energising during my stay."
1845,6990,142183,11/21/10,98719,Adam,"I really enjoyed staying with Cynthia in her beautiful, thought-provoking home.  Cynthia is an artist, and everything in her home is crafted to be comfortable and beautiful.  Cynthia was a laid-back host -- when I was around, if she happened to be eating or cooking, she shared delicious chicken soups and avacado salads with me.  More enjoyably, we shared numerous conversations and I even got to weigh on decorating choices for the next guests!  Anything I needed for my comfort, Cynthia made sure that I had it, and she was also very laid back around my intensive, early and late scheduling needs.  Cynthia made me feel like an old friend, not a new guest, and when I can next come to Manhattan, I plan to stay at Cynthias.  "
1846,6990,144988,11/27/10,162160,CÃ©cile,"Our stay at Cynthia house was excellent. Cynthia was really helpful and helped us when I lost my bag in the shuttle. The room was very nice and the flat is just as the pictures shows, awesome ! The place is just next to the metro station which is very convenient to discover the city. If I had to come back to New York I would definitely choose her place again. Thanks a lot."
1847,6990,149269,12/6/10,240697,Graham,"Cynthiaâ€™s apartment is a work of art. It was a gorgeous place to stay, very clean, warm and convenient for sight seeing. Cynthia is a wonderful host, supplying plenty of New York info and hospitality. I very much look forward to returning."
1848,6990,159190,12/28/10,202456,Adrian,We looked for a true NYC experience when booking Cynthia's apartment and we got it. Cynthia is a marvelous host and presented a truly unique apartment; something of herself that she seeks to share with others.  Cynthia had a genuine interest in us as her guests and treated us like family. We would thoroughly recommend Cynthia's apartment as a base for exploring NYC.  Thank you so much Cynthia.  See you in Oz some time down the track.
1849,6990,165826,1/5/11,240050,Sofia,"Me and my other half stayed at Cynthias from 28th Dec until 4th Jan 2011. The apartment is in a great location about a ten second walk from the subway, and then a quick route straight down to times square. The area is lovely with a great smoothie shop with cheap prices just round the corner which Cynthia kindly took us to. The apartment itself is AMAZING!! Me and my other half absolutely loved everything about her place it was very homely, clean and just stunning!! After a stressful 18 hour journey thanks to many delays, we arrived in the middle of the night and what a relief to arrive to such a nice welcoming apartment was fantastic. Cynthia is a lovely kind hearted, warm person and we are very grateful to have met her and stayed at her beautiful home. We look forward to visiting again hopefully in the summer :)  ps... We stayed in the Grand Room, the bed is extremely comfortable and you will get a great nights sleep!!"
1850,6990,182841,2/15/11,297198,Jason,"Cynthia was a wonderful and accommodating host. I stood the first night with my daughter, and we had a blast playing in the loft rooms she created. Nights two and three I was there with my girlfriend and Cynthia was so helpful with recommending places for us to have breafkast and dinner. She even invited us along to an event and dinner on the last evening we were there. We had a lot of great conversation, and I really enjoyed our little walk and talk while we were looking for a cab. I really appreciated her welcoming demeanor, and I'm sure anyone interested in this location will appreciate this quality of hers as well. "
1851,6990,188204,2/25/11,197375,Rueben,"Living in Cynthias fab apartemment was/is luxury and welbeeing from start to end:-) Cynthia greet you as an old friend or a family member, and you will feel right at home.Cynthia is so easygoing, fun and she takes care of you in a way that I havent experienced anywhere else.I left her place and felt lke we had been roommates forever, and Im SO going back soon:-)"
1852,6990,193245,3/6/11,381605,Catherine,"Cynthia is a warm, talented, vibrant woman, generous to a fault and an total pleasure to spend time with. Her place is true labour of love, its relaxed and feels very much like home, with central park, top notch but reasonably priced restaurants (the local sushi is great!), the illustrious Madison Avenue for shopping, or more downbeat relaxed third avenue. Transport is excellent. In short, it's all you need. Would highly encourage you to stay with Cynthia - you won't regret it. I'll be staying again."
1853,6990,196548,3/11/11,379056,Margaret,"The facts of staying with Cynthia are these: her home is as spectacular as the photos suggest; the location as convenient as the map indicates; the hospitality as generous and considerate as other reviewers testify.The experience of staying with Cynthia is harder to express. I'm back now from five days in New York that might just have changed my life forever. Cynthia's warmth, wisdom and kindliness were a springboard to a rather brilliant adventure that I'm hoping will bring me back to New York, and to this amazing house, again and again. "
1854,6990,204686,3/21/11,382302,Angelo,"Cynthia is an amazing host, she's so welcoming and treats you like family the second you buzz her apartment. I only went to New York for 4 nights and only used the apartment as a place to sleep and leave my bags but even so its been one of the best places i've ever stayed. The apartment it self is in a great location thats quiet, and conveniently located next to 96th street subway which gets you by 5th avenue in 5/10minutes or times square in 10/15minutes. The pictures do not do the apartment justice seeing is believing its like walking into an art exhibition you feel apart of her home straight away. I honestly can write pages upon pages upon pages of how great Cynthia was and how amazing her apartment is but seriously if your even considering booking her apartment do it straight away you wont regret it. I'm already planning my trip back. "
1855,6990,214143,4/1/11,455610,Alan,To say that my stay in this beautiful home was a wonderous experience would be understatement.  The place is a beautiful work of art in a wonderous city with a host who went out of way to make me feel at easy with kindness and helpful advice and a welcoming smile.  If all my airbnb experiences are like this I'd be truelly blessed.  Thank you Cynthia.

She is a great host and the best guide to enjoy the city (as well as her apartment, which is a very nice place to be, a work of art). My name is Diego and I am 34, from Buenos Aires Argentina.  "
1857,6990,228911,4/17/11,458249,Amanda,"Cynthia is a (Website hidden by Airbnb) first Airbnb experience and what a way to start. Extremely accomodating, sociable and caring. The apartment is fantastic and so brilliantly located; I was mainly In Manhatten and walked everywhere. The apartment was very clean, tidy, warm and cosy. I felt at home and safe (as a female travelling on her own I think this is important) Would most definitely book with Cynthia again if in NY. An extremely talented artist too."
1858,6990,249979,5/3/11,479252,Irenejoy,"Cynthia's home is very UNIQUE NEW YORK! My friend and I had an amazing time staying with Cynthia. She was an amazing host and a great person to be around. Very helpful and only a phone call away. My friend and I loved her place, it is colorful and creative, and has a story of its own. I can say her home is my favorite place I've stayed in so far. Her location is great, the subway is right around the corner, and Central Park is only 3 blocks away. I truely would recommend others to stay at Cynthia's home. Cythnia thanks for letting us stay at your home we had a lovely time!! "

1860,6990,278514,5/24/11,475508,Angus,"Best holiday ever, facilitated by CynthiaÂ´s supreme hospitality, warmth and not least her breathtaking apartment. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay from start to finish and Cynthia treated us like old friends from the moment we walked in the door.The location was excellent - just a minuteÂ´s walk from the nearest subway. The bed was comfortable and the apartment was spotless throughout. But the greatest plus was Cynthia herself - always smiling and helpful with plenty of great stories to tell and full of interesting ideas for sightseeing and restaurants.I canÂ´t recommend this apartment highly enough."
1861,6990,285704,5/29/11,234315,Sharon,"We started our wonderful trip to the big apple with a town car at the airport that was arranged by Cynthia.  Then a warm greeting by our host.  She showed us around her neighborhood and gave us very sound advice about the subways and how to get around.  She prepared us a hearty breakfast every morning and sent cheerly on our way. Her apartment is cool, very comfortable, very clean and easy to get to. We had a wonderful time in NYC and she was definitely a contributing factor.I will stay there again."
1862,6990,297904,6/5/11,446979,Katrina,"I enjoyed my stay with Cynthia tremendously!!  Her home is more beautiful than I ever imagined.  It was a wonderful experience spending time with her and she is brillant at making her guests feel comfortable.  She offers a warm haven to live that feels like home and her beautiful artwork is a festival for the eyes in every room.  I did not want to leave.  I felt like I was not just a guest, but part of her family. She goes the extra mile to welcoming her guests into her home.   She spent a lot of time helping me get settled and giving me valuable information about places to eat and and have fun.  This was my first real visit to New York City and Cynthia was a most wise philosopher and guide to the city and to life. I couldn't believe how fortunate I was to have her as my host.   She has so much positive passion and energy about her work and about people and she had a life changing effect on me.  I am thrilled I got to meet her, and  honored to call her a friend.  People like Cynthia do not come around all the time, and when you get a rare opportunity to know them,  PLEASE GRAB IT!!!!!!! "

1864,6990,320187,6/18/11,371051,Kimberly Anne,"Cynthia is nothing short of awesome!!! Her home is gorgeous, I liken it to a museum yet it's cozy and comfortable too. Cynthia wants only the best for her guests and it shows - super plush towels, soft soft sheets, lots of laughter and if you're lucky, an escapade or two. A few blocks to one of the most gorgeous areas of Central Park and 1 block from a central subway line. Live it up in style and comfort in this fantastic one of a kind experience! "

She was also very flexible with check-in and out times. We took a shower after our last day in NYC and could let our luggages over there. However for us : a family who travels with a child combined with the jet lag (early wake up at 5 am), this is not the most convenient place to stay as we felt uncomfortable to disturb our host. We should have opted for something more anonymous but this is our mistake. "
1869,6990,390123,7/23/11,510279,Sophia,"First, take your shoes off, because you are about to enter holy ground. It's an honor to be in a home with so much love put in it, where you can truly relax. Forget the city you can spend your days exploring all the exquisite craftsmanship that goes in for your pleasure. Central park, the shopping and museums are amazing too, which are walking distance away. But the reason why you'll fall in love with everything New York is your incredible host on E 97th. Save some granola for me. Cynthia, you soulful divine woman you, who had me in stitches most of the time. So people, this is a place and a host who is not to be taken for granted. Only book here if your heart is oversized and you want your experiences inside and out to be Himalayan. Cynthia, you are New York. (Phone number hidden by Airbnb)"

I took the trrain eveyday from a subway stop a block away it as great. The decor is just wonderful I love the electic/victorian feel and it was very clean.Cynthia is a very concerned hostess and makes sure you don't get lost and she offerrs money saving ideas.My room was nice but if you are suffering from arthtis and hot flashes it  may be a little diffcult climbing up to your loft bed. The steps are higher than normal steps and air circulation is tight. The next time I will rent the grand room."

1872,6990,480973,8/28/11,559202,Kane,"Cynthia is a very warm, gregarious and generous personality and her place is one of a kind.  We were in town but due to lesve the night of Hurricane Irene but Cynthia was flexible in the circumstances and willing to let us stay on if we needed it.  The house is warm, colorful and very social and entertaining, so it would suit travelers seeking a social experience rather than more private types.  We had lots of great moments, and only some minor misunderstandings  (our host was away when we first arrived, which we knew would be the case in advance, but were unsure of just some basic stuff like house rules which then had to be explained when our host returned!). All in all, highly recommended for anyone seeking a social and fun NY experience in the Upper East of Manhattan"
1873,6990,521956,9/11/11,1103612,Tiffany,"Cynthia is so nice! She met me at the door and helped with my luggage on the rainy night in which I arrived. The next morning ( every morning) she made breakfast or made sure I had something to eat before I headed out for the day. I stayed in the blue velvet room in which I felt I was climbing into a special Moroccan tree house every night. This place is perfect if you need a clean, single place to sleep and shower. You will enjoy the special experience! Good luck!"

1876,6990,562207,9/24/11,928862,Daniel,This was my first shared AirBNB experience and it was interesting and enjoyable.  Cynthia is a delightful hostess who made my stay very comfortable.  The bedrooms are not ideal for tall people (like me) but her location is super close to the subway lines and her home is very artistic and clean!  I would stay there again just to hang out with Cynthia!

1882,6990,760169,12/3/11,692813,Carol,"Cynthiaâ€™s endearing comments about Judy and I as her houseguests make my eyes misty.   Staying with Cynthia gave our fabulous trip an added dimension for enjoyment.  Cynthiaâ€™s persona is very spiritual to me.  She has a unique quality that captivates youâ€_.and she is also funny.Cynthiaâ€™s home had never-ending artistic discovery on a daily basis for us, such as the totally unique water basin, the odd choice of a lamp shade in the kitchen, the mosaic mirrored kitchen back-splash as well as the shower surround, etc.  Cynthiaâ€™s highly acclaimed photographic artistry translates to her home dÃ©cor.Cynthiaâ€™s warmth and kindness were so appreciated as she escorted us around the neighborhood with dining recommendations, subway lessonsâ€”which we flunked on our first adventure differentiating UPTOWN vs. DOWNTOWN, but her subsequent tutorial straightened us out.Cynthia and my traveling companion are twin â€œneat freaksâ€ù as far as cleanliness whereas I required forgiveness from time to time; to wit, the ultimate infraction of  wearing my boots in the house.  However, after Cynthia recovered from the shock to her cleanliness gene, she quickly forgave me with the admonition, â€œNO SHOES IN THE HOUSE.â€ùCynthiaâ€™s blended energy drink in the morning enabled me as a 79-year-old broad to keep up with my young sidekick Judy.  Cynthia became our â€œHouse Mother,â€ù waiting for our safe return at night with our daily report.The most surprising revelation on this trip was how sweet and helpful the local New Yorkers  are to tourists.  There is a misconception that New Yorkers are rude, brusque and arrogant.  The opposite is true! In all my travels worldwide, I have never encountered nicer people who go out of their way to help you.Â·	Judy and Carol       Â·	Â·	Â·	Â·	Â·	By: Cynthia KThis is one of the beauties about airbnb, you get to meet people that you would not normally get a chance to meet. Carol came with her friend Judy. The 2 took to NYC and rode the tour game in joy and laughter, making the home-towner me see the city again. Carol is also the hero, where love wins the day. She married her high school sweetheart, while now in her late 70's, she wears the smile of a happy ever ending story. I can only hope that more people will get the chance to meet this fabulous woman. Thank you Carol and Judy for staying here, I had fun."

1884,6990,800863,12/23/11,229907,Ian,"From the moment I saw the photos of Cynthia's apartment in New York I wanted to stay there. She is a fabulous hostess, so helpful and considerate. Nothing was too much trouble for her and I appreciated being invited to some of the activities that she was doing. That was a great way for me to learn more about New York (particularly as I was travelling on my own).I've often thought about the option of taking an apartment by myself (as I did in Paris last year) but my experiences with Cynthia strongly tip the balance in sharing with an owner, it is so much more sociable and  enjoyable. Thanks for your hospitality Cynthia!!!"
1885,6990,832334,1/3/12,1471457,Mayra-Alejandra,"Cynthia was great! Made me feel at home! She prepared lovely smoothies and fruit drinks every morning to start the day.I stayed there for 8 nights. Privacy was never an issue until the second room got booked. Made the last couple of nights uncomfortable. Overall, excellent place to stay. Cynthia will invite you to meet her friends and welcomes you with such great energy. She's hilarious! Awesome sense of humor. She's extremely easy going and fun to talk to. Her art work is amazing and she'll tell you all about it.If you ever get sick, or need to stay the day in, she has a variety of films on her Netflex. She's honestly a genuine and lovely person to be around with. I will definitely book her home again."

Always she is very helpful and facilitate to come from the JFK Airport or other places you want to visit. Cynthia's apartment in the Upper East and close from subway stations and buses. The home is very clean and quiet, my room was comfortable. After the day in NYC, it is relaxant to come back easily with subway or bus to the home. Cynthia knows to be considerate . I will recommend this place for friends who wants discover NYC and living in one friendly apartment and need help when it is necessary. xavier"
1887,6990,974523,3/6/12,1723761,David,A fantastic and generous host. Very much looking forward to staying with Cynthia again soon. 
1888,6990,1073686,4/2/12,1814362,Ben,"Cynthia is a great person to stay with; expect smoothies, art and noodles. Her apartment is appropriately luxurious and you're well situated on the 4-5-6 Metro lines which give you connections to the rest of the city, not to mention being a stone's throw from the bigger galleries and museums of Manhattan. A fantastic few days. Strongly recommended."
1889,6990,1147609,4/18/12,1799380,Monika,"To meet Cynthia and to stay in her tasteful outfitted appartement was a great pleasure for me. Cynthia is a very sympatic and warm person and she has an amazing positive attitude towards life. She is a wonderful and provident host, helpful in every situation. I had a phantastic and secure time in New York and after tiring tours in 'downtown' I felt like coming home. Her smoothies in the morning are the cherry on top."
1890,6990,1178573,4/25/12,1252123,Rodrigo,"Amazing place and location, i would recommend this place to anyone who is traveling to NYC! the place to stay!  Cynthia was so helpful and she is the most amazing person that you will meet in your travels! THANK YOU CYNTHIA FOR EVERYTHING :)"
1891,6990,1265747,5/12/12,1860524,Lucy,"stay was wonderful, the place makes you feel home and cosy. cynthia made her famous smoothies every morning. she is a great host. i would recommend her place to everyone. not only because cynthia is so taking care of her guests and beeing helpful in any kind of matters, she just got something, that not everyone has it. "
1892,6990,1355440,5/27/12,1881125,Steven,"This is, indeed, one of New York's most-unique destinations.Cynthia is an internationally-known visual artist with formal architectural training, and her home is the product of 22 years of sustained artistic focus. The photos are accurate but cannot capture a myriad small details such as the elegant solutions for concealing piping and wiring runs, or for ensuring adequate airflow between the lofts and open areas. At one point, I got a glimpse of a concealed wiring closet as she relocated her wifi base station -- I was impressed by the carefully-designed infrastructure that lies beneath the sumptuous exterior. As an extra treat, Cynthia's artwork graces the walls. The overall effect is stunning, like living in a bohemian fin-de-siÃ¨cle palace -- admittedly a compact one, but a palace, nonetheless.Cynthia herself is the epitome of the perfect hostess.  Her warmth and generosity is beyond compare. Her morning smoothies are the perfect metaphor -- healthy, fresh, and sustaining.  Living successfully in a small shared place requires the willingness to balance intimacy with privacy, and she handles that balancing act with effortless grace. In the last week of my two-week stay, I fell ill. Cynthia went overboard to ensure that I was comfortable, even to the point of getting chicken soup for me! There is a large community of people around Cynthia, some drawn initially by her miniature palace.  I feel lucky to have joined that community. "
1893,6990,1418111,6/5/12,446979,Katrina,"I enjoyed staying with Cynthia so much!  She works very hard to  take excellent care of her guests. She offers shelter that not only gives the body rest and renewal,  but also feeds the mind.   If you are lucky enough to get a chance to stay with her, you will never forget this trans formative experience.  "
1894,6990,2076744,8/23/12,3242940,Bonnie,A truly lovely experience! Cynthia's gorgeous home was an excellent base for me to really explore the Upper East Side and her suggestions for the very best places to dine and visit were perfect. Cynthia organised everything seamlessly and she was so helpful that it was very easy to move in and have an excellent week. Thank you Cynthia - I shall return! 
1895,6990,2276830,9/14/12,2448685,Ludger,"I stayed 2 weeks in Cynthia's home, which really is a place of artwork. I spent all days outside and made my daily reports after that in the blue room. I often finished at midnight.  The days were fully planned. So I was happy to be in a place next to the subway. Cynthia gave me some advices, called a taxi for me, and I loved her smoothies in the morning. Thank you for that very much, Cynthia! But I would like to point out a few things which should be mentioned. The pictures do not show the true dimensions of the blue room. The blue room is only about 6  square meters bed included. There is only a bench to sit on with no backrest. Stairs lead you to your bed. The bed goes over the floor. The room is open to the ceiling. Underneath is place for your clothes as well as on the opposite side. Real space to live in is therefore very very narrow.  The room is not separated enough. Everybody in the flat can hear everything you say.  There is no privacy in that room. There was not a single table with a chair in normal size in the kitchen nor in the living room nor in the blue room. I found a few bar stools in the kitchen, one of them I could use  in my room to reach my laptop. If you prepare your meal in the kitchen you have to eat from the working place sitting on a bar stool or standing. The fridge is too small for more than 1 person if rooms are booked. There is no microwave. The flat is shoe free, but Cynthia did not say that she does not like sandals or slippers. She walks barefoot and wanted me to do so or in my socks. I do not like that.  The place is beautiful, but to pay 95 $ for a room of 6 square meters?  Cynthia is nice at one hand. But she gave me the feeling that she cared at first about every piece in her flat, then about her guest. I would wish to see more respect for the dignity of guests from different countries with different aspects of life. Do I recommend? For people who like such very small places, yes."
1896,6990,2308091,9/17/12,3231245,Dita,"Cynthia  makes you feel at home immediately , and her home is  a fabulous and special  place to stay when visiting NYC . Her home is  wonderful with thought given to every detail from the mosaic on the kitchen wall, the Aladdin treasure cave rooms ,the gorgeous bathroom and the stunning living room. But even more lovely is Cynthia herself , who takes care of her guests from the morning smoothies to the evening welcome when you return after a day in the city. I feel really  lucky that I stayed with her and will come back next year."

1898,6990,2518037,10/6/12,343939,Lynne,"One of the best things about my trip to New York was meeting Cynthia.  Waking up to her blending her famous 'happy juice' or arriving home to hear about her latest home project after a long day exploring New York was refreshing.  Simply, we clicked like sisters...and were never at a loss to find things to talk about.  As numerous other guests have said, her place is an inspiration to anyone artistic.  It's a continual work in progress with creative ideas flowing.  The two weeks I spent with her flew by.  As it was, we ran out of time for Raman noodles!  If you're looking for a place to stay where you immediately feel like you're with family or a close friend, this is the place.  She's spotlessly clean and graciously attends to any needs you may have.  If I have the opportunity to use Airbnb again, I can only hope I find a host as amazing as Cynthia.  Thank-you 'Mama' for a great introduction to New York.  Until I see you again...  :)October, 2012"
1899,6990,2598381,10/13/12,1880860,Fernando,"Cynthia, oh Cynthia. How can I start about her and her lovely home?Well it all really is perfect. She is a very thoughtful hostess: she makes â€˜happy juiceâ€™ every day, she is talkative, inviting, patient, interesting and warm.Her home is just gorgeous, being an Interior Designer myself, I totally fell in love with the whole European flair and uniqueness of this lovely and well located apartment in a safe and nice area in the Upper East.You just canâ€™t ask for more. An experience I am so thankful for having!"
1900,6990,2642649,10/17/12,1660681,Susan,"As everyone has said, Cynthia's place is beautiful and she is great fun. I regret that I was out and about so much that I didn't have much time to chat.  But that said, the place is perfect for social folks who want to get out and around. It's convenient to the subway, there are restaurants in the area, and the apartment is clean. Cynthia is a wonderful host. It's not the place for someone who wants to spend a great deal of time in their room alone. The room is small (but has plenty of room for all your stuff and a comfortable bed), and even with all the lights on, it's quite dark. But who goes to New York to stay in their room! The living room is wonderful and bright and comfortable, so if you have work to do you can sit in there. I'd definitely stay here again."
1901,6990,2874578,11/13/12,3354541,Narelle,"Staying at Cynthia's apartment was an amazing experience, as not only is it perfectly located, but it's a beautiful, restful space to reside in. Cynthia made amazing smoothies every morning, and was a perfect host to hang out with. Everything in her apartment was geared towards making my stay as comfortable as possible. I would definetely recommend her apartment and I would also stay there again. You do require some athleticism to climb into the bed space, but this didn't cause an issue for me. "
1902,6990,2908450,11/18/12,1723605,Polo,"My stay at Cynthia was simply fantastic. The location could not be better. Only a block away from the subway station. Three blocks away from central park... How about a walk in the park? Yes, please!! Plenty of restaurants, coffee shops (Yes, including Starbucks for those of you who are not willing to support small but great businesses). Cleaners, delis, clothing stores, barber shops... You get my point!. The actual place is UNIQUE. I doubt that many places in NYC are as nice as this little apartment. The building, like many in NYC is old but very well kept. Cynthia's apartment is beautiful. Small but so well organized and decorated that every little corner has personality. Cynthia is an artist and she is constantly working on her apartment and expressing her art throughout the entire place. The room is small but I was amazed with how much she was able to accomplish in that little space. She certainly has been able to create the feeling of an entire bedroom in the two cozy niches she has put together. She is a smart and charismatic lady. Always concerned about one's comfort. I enjoyed every conversation I had with her as she did not hesitate to share her thoughts on any given subject. Her fruit smoothies are just great and energetic. The perfect start for every morning. I can go on and on about this place but let just put it simply. Go ahead and book. You will not be disappointed. It will add to your whole experience next time you are in NYC. "
1903,6990,2997201,11/30/12,202657,Imogen,"Cynthia was the perfect host for me. She took me out and about, showed me around the area and filled me in on pretty much everything that I needed to know for my first time here in New York. Her home is absolutely stunning!"

1909,6990,4663595,5/19/13,5895781,Francesca,"Cynthia was an incredible host. She was warm, and kind, inviting me to gallery openings, taking me for runs on Central Park, and helping me plan my subway rides each day. The house is gorgeous, quiet, and unique. I slept wonderfully in the Blue Room, and Cynthia sweetly accommodated my early to bed, early to rise schedule. I'll be reaching out to her any time I'm in NYC. . "
1910,6990,4750163,5/23/13,6298428,Kayla,"My second time to NYC & first time solo; also my first time using Airbnb. I am very glad I stayed at Cynthia's. I would highly recommend staying here if you want to get away from the ""touristy"" part of the city & explore the neighbourhoods. She is right in the heart of the Upper East Side. It was a wonderful stay. Here is my review: long & hopefully detailed enough. Cynthia as a host was fantastic. She had booked a car service for me to & from the airport (cheaper than a cab), & greeted me with open arms when I arrived. She immediately struck up conversation; this girl can talk, & her conversations are intriguing & wonderful. She respected that I wasn't a morning person, & kept quiet in the mornings. She let me borrow her umbrella during the one day that it poured. She gave me a subway map & explained the lines to me. She provided me with a list of nearby cafe's, restaurants, & grocery stores. She also gave me the low down on what's up with the museum admissions... I suggest staying with her if you want to know about that as well. Overall, she was very kind & helpful & I appreciated it all. The apartment itself looks exactly like the photos & is so thoughtfully & artistically designed & detailed. It was also extremely clean! Staying here was an experience in itself. Keep in mind the ""no shoes in the apartment"" rule is a strict one; all shoes are kept outside. Cynthia walks around barefoot, & I was comfortable doing the same, but if you aren't, make sure to bring socks or slippers. I found the loft very comfortable after my days of wandering around. There is an air conditioner up there that you have control over, which was very nice. The room was small but cozy, & the only thing worth mentioning is that the walls of the room & loft do not go all the way up to the ceiling so you will hear everything in the apartment. Also, the door to the room is see-through, so you do not have 100% privacy. Changing in the little dressing room was a bit tough for me at 5'4"" tall; consider changing in the bathroom if you are taller. The rest of the apartment is perfect. The area is wonderful. A pharmacy & Starbucks & a subway station within a block walk; Central Park steps away with the Reservoir greeting you when you enter. Museum Mile is close as well. Getting down to Brooklyn Bridge took about 20 minutes on the express lines & another 5 down to Bowling Green & Battery Park. Not too difficult to get to Times Square either. Overall, fantastic location. Lots of cute shops & places to eat. Very non-touristy feeling. I will be contacting Cynthia again if I ever need a place to stay in NYC. 5 star rating from me; fantastic stay. Would highly recommend...."
1911,6990,7102317,9/6/13,7189005,Dirk,"From the moment i walked into the apartment i knew this was a different kind of airbnb experience. The interior decoration is beautiful and each room looks great in its own unique way, with chandeliers, mosaics and chic modern art all around.Cynthia is a generous and kind person who went out of her way to make my five days in New York as fun and easy as it could possibly be. There are lots of grocery stores, restaurants, and things to do in the area, and walking around was pretty safe at night. Central Park is a five minute walk, the subway is 90 seconds away, and there's also the metro museum of art about a 15 minute walk away. All really convenient, but if you'll be spending most of your time downtown then lower Manhattan is very easy to get to in about 20-25 minutes on the subway, and Times Square is about the same with one train transfer on the way.Cynthia was extremely considerate and always thinking ahead - she really is a wonderful host in what many might see as an intimidating city. New York is a great city full of predominantly great people, and Cynthia really made it feel that way as soon as i got there - after the first night i was more than comfortable and really enjoyed myself, when maybe i would have been a bit tentative going out at night by myself, it was great. I absolutely loved my stay and will be trying to make sure that all my friends stay with Cynthia when visiting this great city in the future."

Her home is beautiful, albeit eccentric, and tip-top clean. The shower is great, I felt at home in the kitchen making tea and helping myself to cereal, the bed was very comfortable and linens exquisite and it's quiet quiet quiet at night. Location is great too -- an easy subway ride downtown, walkable to Guggenheim and Met, good restaurants in the hood, I felt fine walking home late at night too. I recommend it and would stay again."

A great find! Opulently decorated with art work by the owner/host, it is well presented, clean and comfortable. Even though the rooms are snug, it is more than enough for the single intrepid traveller. Breakfast is a healthy mix of granola, hemp and chia seeds, raw chocolate a dash of agave oil and a generous dollop of natural yoghurt. A great starter for the busy day of sightseeing or shopping aead. Close to the subway direct to downtown and a short stroll to Central Park, it also has many facilities in the area including a 24hour convenience store/pharmacy, some great eateries and drinking holes. Best of all, the host, Cynthia, is a warm and most approachable person.

1933,6990,15629502,7/13/14,13981991,Daria,"Staying with Cynthia was a great experience! She's a caring host.who wants nothing but total comfort for her guests. She makes great beverages for breakfast, has amazing feather-soft bath towels, amazingly comfortable bed, air conditioning (you'll need it in NYC in the summertime) and fast wifi. The location is very good and the neighbourhood is safe. Besides physical comfort you also get a great interesting person to chat with, she will tell you anything you need to know about the city and more. It was my first time with Airbnb and I am so happy: I found this intelligent and smart woman and I'll definitely stay at this place again."
1934,6990,16475140,7/28/14,16729889,Jessie,I loved staying with Cynthia. She is very nice and accommodating. The place is beautiful and a great location in the middle of Manhattan. Breakfast was delicious and made a great start to a fabulous day in New York City. A great safe neighborhood to stay in if you are a lone traveler wanting to explore this amazing city. The room is quite small but very dark and quiet so it is great for sleeping and getting over jet lag. 
1935,6990,16773689,8/2/14,15996582,John,"When looking for accommodation I insist that three conditions are always met, cleanliness, easy access to public transport and lots of positive reviews, and this property delivered on all three and more besides. Cynthia replies promptly with booking requests and general queries about her place and when I arrived she showed me round her immediate neighbourhood and helped me with purchasing my MetroCard. She takes her responsibility as a host seriously and that can only be a good thing for any future guests. This was my first  Airbnb booking."
1936,6990,17563115,8/14/14,15676144,Jack,"Cynthia est une personne chaleureuse qui sait recevoir les voyageurs. Sa sensibilitÃ© artistique donne Ã  sa demeure un cotÃ© atypique et trÃ¨s personnel. Ã‡a restera une belle rencontre.a bientÃ´t Cynthia. "
1937,6990,17873367,8/18/14,18346148,Bobin,Cynthia was very friendly and nice. The room I stayed was small and cozy.The apartment was beautiful and comfortable. I think the location was perfect and close to central park and subways. She made sure to make me comfortable and apartment was  clean and maintained really well. I could use the kitchen and had choices of breakfast which makes you feel like being at your home :). I look forward to staying her  again too.
1938,6990,18404327,8/26/14,16524715,Tom,"Cynthia's apartment is beautifully unique, you need only take the detail of her images & description as a guide of a thoughtful host. The furnishings and decoration are such a pleasure, comfortable and full of creative energy. A perfect location for art lovers, little more than 10 blocks from the Guggenheim, and with the Whitney & MET just beyond, along with Central Park's Conservatory Water. All central sights are walking distance, and key subway lines are just 1 block away if you prefer. Such good conversation from a like creative mind, someone who made me feel considered, thoughtfully accommodated and made me feel safe as a lone traveller, even inviting me to dinner. No small detail was not thought of. An excellent apartment, great recommendations and someone who added even more flair to a wonderful trip. "
1939,6990,18664261,8/30/14,8254684,Thijs,"This was my first airbnb and it was a great experience at Cynthia's. The atmosphere of the apartment and her charming personality added greatly to my NY experience. In short: prompt and great communication, a clean, relaxing and comfortable apartment with the facilities in perfect working condition. A helpful and friendly hostess who takes care of her airbnb in a professional way. Access to main subway line is just around the corner. I would definitely book it again if i am staying in NY."
1940,6990,19074142,9/6/14,17193454,Barbara,"Cynthia was a great host who really helped me to feel comfortable at home and finding my way into the New York jungle. The room was tiny but had everything I needed. Most important, it was completely quiet - something to appreciate when staying in a big city! The apartment is just beautiful with all decorations and details, and it is close to Central Park, the subway and museums."
1941,6990,19460458,9/13/14,7272578,Katrina,"Great location, one block from metro stop and 3 blocks from Central Park which. Was important for me as I needed to continue some training. Cynthia's created a unique and warm home and she has fantastic energy, I don't know how she does it. Great suggestions on local places to shop and available for advice at any time. Hope to visit again and would recommend to anyone. "
1942,6990,19819507,9/19/14,17753783,Talia,"I had a wonderful NY experience with Cynthia K. For a start, she was very responsive, and communication was easy and efficient. Before I arrived she provided many suggestions and tips of how to get there and things I could do and see.When I arrived her welcome was warm and made me feel at home immediately. Cynthia was a great host - she was there when I needed her but I had privacy otherwise. In addition, she helped with all those little things one may need - an umbrella on a rainy day, a laminated subway map, etc.The house is a real gem - everywhere you look there is another thing to explore. And everything is spotless and well maintained.It is under 1 minute walk to the nearest subway, very close to central park, and within an easy walk from some of the most famous museums.I had a great time and certainly hope to stay there again. "
1943,6990,20491822,9/30/14,17118126,Nicole,"Cynthia is a fantastic host. She made me feel welcome from the very first moment I entered her apartment. She cares for the well-being of her guests, is very helpful with practical information (transportation in NYC, good places to eat etc.) and she is always open for a chat. The room is small but clean and very quiet and you are free to use the living room and kitchen. The apartment itself is worth a visit! Every room is furnished and decorated with an artistic touch that is a feast for the eye. The atmosphere is nice and comfortable. Situated on a quiet street on the upper east side, the apartment is in walking distance from Central Park and very close to a subway station with a direct line to downtown Manhattan (approx. 15 min.). It is thus easy to get to and from the place and the area feels secure, also at night.I can warmly recommend a stay at Cynthia's!"
1944,6990,21201890,10/13/14,19558439,Kathryn,"Cynthia provides so much more than a bed to sleep in (which was extremely comfortable by the way). The apartment is also her studio so expect to see art in the making and witness her passion and excitement about her work. It is also her home, so there are a few rules (alas I managed to forget most of them at least once - *sorry* Cynthia). Highly recommended."

Great pizzas & burger joint nearby. The flat is incredible. Totally art deco. The rooms are small but very well furnished.

The rest of the house looked really awesome too. And it was all very clean and well taken care of. The area was very calm. It was very convenient that there was a subway station very nearby.So all in all, it was a very good experience "

The Oak Room is a nice space, with a comfortable bed, space to your things and be sure you gonna have a good rest there.

1959,6990,28254587,3/21/15,25082050,Elaine,"My week-long stay was simply fantastic.  The apartment and facilities were exactly as described.  Really well located for easy access to the subway (96th) and a short ride from the centre of the city.  I also appreciated the relative peace which you don't get if you're staying in the centre in a hotel which meant I slept really, really well there.  My stay offered me the opportunity to feel like I genuinely lived in NYC; which is exactly what I was looking for.  Staying there was a luxurious, quirky &  thoroughly enjoyable experience.  Being so close to Central Park was a real bonus.  The plethora of high quality coffee shops, bars, restaurants and shops within 5 minutes walk was brilliant.  Cynthia was totally amazing; an absolute gem!  She was welcoming, super helpful, fun, creative interesting and intelligent; what a fabulous combo!  Just brilliant to be around.  Her beautiful homes reflects her and is handcrafted with love.  Without a doubt I will definitely be back to stay there again - I like to think of Cynthia's beautiful apartment as my Carrie Bradshaw getaway in the gorgeous NYC.  I loved every minute of it!  Don't hesitate - book it now!  What are you waiting for?!"

Cynthia is an artist who has spent decades making her space into a haven of mosaic walls, rustic doors, and antique chandeliers. It's a lovely surprise tucked into an otherwise straightforward, unadorned building. The room itself is small, but high ceilings and well-placed mirrors make it seem more spaciousness. As a place to sleep, the room reminded me of an old-fashioned sleeper berth on a very fancy train; it was dark, calm, and quiet. Cynthia is a wonderful and generous host who makes tea, breakfast smoothies, and even fresh, warm soy milk; she also knows the best places in the neighborhood to get ramen, pizza, and cheeseâ€”all very important. Staying with her was a very special unique experience, and I can see why her room is so consistently booked! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.Cynthia was a more-than-gracious host "

Going above and beyond what one expects of a host, Cynthia helped me carry my (VERY heavy) duffle bag to the cab, and as a bonus, she yanked me out of the path of a bus I was distracted enough to almost walk in front of.I very much enjoyed my stay at Cynthia's place--the pictures don't begin to do it justice.  Works of art and lovely, quirky little touches are everywhere.  She made her crust-less apple ""pie"" (which was delicious!) as a welcome, and kindly left a light on at night to make it easier to navigate to the bathroom.  One evening when I got home early we sat on the front stoop talking for an hour--she's a very interesting person.The bedroom is TINY, and the bed is small but very comfortable--I slept great for the five nights I was there.  Everything was very clean and well-maintained.  I highly recommend this lovely spot with its welcoming host--it is right down the street from the subway, as well as a Starbucks, a drugstore, and some very cool little restaurants.

I think the major value of AirBnB is not just finding a place to stay, but being able to see life through a different lense, that of the host. That said, the place is something else and I don't think I'd do it justice by trying to describe it. Do yourself a favor and stay a few nights there. The location is great as the museums and the park are right there. The 6 train is right around the corner and it'll take all the way down to the lower parts of Manhattan fairly quickly"

Right away from all the touristy hoo-har of mid-town and downtown, but easily accessible on two subway lines - the 6 and the Q. If you're staying for over a week like I did, Cyn will provide you with a metro card. All you have to do is load it up for $32 and you go anywhere and everywhere you want. But the best thing about this place is Cyn herself. I started most of my mornings with a healthy smoothie and oodles of interesting chit-chat.

Her place is beautiful, eclectic and cozy. Great location as well as it is one block away from the 6 subway line, a few blocks away from Central Park, and close to many grocery stores, places to eat and a 24 hour pharmacy.  Would not highly recommend more for a great and convenient place to stay in New York!!"
2043,7036,254793,5/7/11,387311,Donald,Very clean and tiny house with fantastic location (only two blocks from Church Ave (F/G)! Akiko tried her best to help me organise my logistic issues with a prompt communication. Great experience in NY and I do appreciate her hospitality.
2044,7036,271510,5/19/11,577952,Chow,The host canceled my reservation 3 days before arrival.
2045,7036,338171,6/27/11,501947,Harold,This listing is part of a relatively new condo ... immaculately clean with all the conveniences e.g. washer/dryer and cable TV. There is also a nice roof area to enjoy warm weather days. The Brooklyn neighborhood is very quiet and there is a subway station a couple blocks away. If you're looking for an economical selection with all the trappings this is your spot. The host is also very attentive and helpful.
2046,7036,551761,9/20/11,830667,Sheree,"The place is very nice. It's new, clean and very accessible to subway. Area is very safe, lots of food choices around. Akiko is very helpful and accommodating. Highly recommended."
2047,7064,80175,8/17/10,164163,Bradley,What a great spot. The apartment is spacious and relaxing. The neighborhood has tons of great food and is great for getting to Manhattan or other neighborhoods in Brooklyn. To top it all off Joelle is very communicative and went out of her way to accommodate my travel plans. I would certainly go back the next time I'm in NY.
2048,7064,127718,10/26/10,198013,Svetlana,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Joelle, but her place is super cool and with lots of character. It is located centrally in the Williamsburg area. There are a lot of interesting shops, cafes and bars just a step away from the apartment. I had a chance to meet and chat a bit with Joelle's roommate below as well as one of the neighbours and they were both extremely friendly and helpful. I had a great time here and would love to return again when in Brooklyn/NY. "
2049,7064,431965,8/9/11,257793,Mireia,un lugar ideal para relajarse y vivir el ambiente de Williamsburg en un espacio muy acojedor y con buenisima energia. Excelente anfitriona.
2050,7064,835010,1/3/12,1349379,Tim,"The apartment was great, the location was perfect and Joelle was a great host - very helpful ( especially considering I booked very last minute ). I'd definitely stay again."
2051,7064,2843438,11/9/12,3384682,Mathilde,We had a very great time at Joelle's place ! the neighborood is a very charming one and the room we lived in was very spaceful and nice.
2052,7064,6785606,8/25/13,7174886,Cindy,"My daughter and I stayed at Joelle's place for about a month and it was an overall wonderful experience. To start with Joelle was great throughout about providing consistently clear and concise communication,  just enough to be helpful but not at all intrusive.  She was there to meet us even as our arrival time was somewhat ""iffy"" and late night.  She provided us with several pamphlets about local attractions, events, etc., suggested several late night eateries, and drew maps to subway stations close by. Though Joelle was out of town for the remainder of our trip, she left us well supported with information, contact info. for herself and neighbors, and checked in with us a couple of times throughout our stay. Joelle's roommate, Annie, who was there for part of our stay, was a wonderful balance of friendly, helpful, yet respectful of using the common areas and of our privacy. The apartment is just as fantastic as it looks in the photos. The bedroom area is a large open area containing within it a cozy living area and a long desk/work area backed with wall-to-wall book shelves. The kitchen and bathroom(on the same floor) were a nice size for our needs.  Both spaces have ample skylights which of course provided great natural lighting and completed that amazing airy loft feel. Joelle had thoughtfully cleared storage space in the closet, kitchen, and bathroom areas, so we had more than enough space for our belongings.  We ended up eating quite a few meals at home and the kitchen efficiently met our needs. The space in general provided a very comfortable and peaceful refuge at the end of our busy days.The apartment is located in a great neighborhood, very convenient to a wide variety of restaurants, shops, etc.while not being in the midst of too much noise and commotion.  There are two subway stations within comfortable walking distance, a bus stop close by,  and there's even a movie theater at the end of the block. (My daughter, a cinephile, was in heaven!) In terms of security, the neighborhood felt very safe and the apartment itself has two locked doors to gain entrance, so security was never an issue.In a one-sentence wrap-up, we loved the whole experience and would do it again in a heartbeat! Thanks Joelle and Annie!"
2053,7064,18306856,8/25/14,797731,Noam,"You'll find Joelle's Boho-chic apartment deep in the heart of boisterous Williamsburg. If you wanna get to know the area there's no better place from which to do it. Joelle is responsive, kind, open and full of only good intentions. With the L train a short walk away you're minutes from Manhattan. I recommend the waterfront and the Polish bakery on North 8th."
2054,7064,33052265,5/24/15,10844162,Collyn,"Such a wonderful place, super calm and relaxing, and very welcoming host at the last minute! "

The place is beautiful and spacious. I would gladly stay here in the future (though thankfully my housing situation is resolved!)"
2056,7097,24107,1/16/10,36847,Rich,"A great space for a fair price in one of Brooklyns best neighborhoods. Bed was comfortable and had access to a washer dryer which was extremely helpful as well as nicely appointed sitting room   There were many wonderful eateries within a 4 or 5 block areaI highly recommend this one"
2057,7097,38324,4/26/10,102024,Lianne,"Gorgeous brownstone renovation in a nice neighborhood.  It definitely WAS ""perfect for parents"".  We had the top floor with big, comfy bed.  Attention to detail, immaculately clean, welcoming host.  Highly recommend this."
2058,7097,39850,5/3/10,110176,Edan,"Highly recommend.  My parents recently stayed with J., they loved her house.  J was friendly and hospitable, offering a tour of her entire home which blew them away - J. has put tremendous love and effort into restoring her brownstone.  The garden unit was clean, large, and beautifully furnished.  And the attached garden was extremely attractive.  The bed is a foldout but reportedly quite comfortable (and my father is a big guy, he presents a real test for a bed!).  The ""kitchen"" has a sink, coffee maker, fridge, but no stove/oven.  I give J.'s place four stars only because the last guest had not adequately cleaned the dishes and there was no sponge with which to do the job, we had to go out and buy one.  Minor quibble.  Apart from that, it was a five star experience for a fair price.  "
2059,7097,44638,5/21/10,115645,Caroline,"We felt so lucky to have found this garden apartment and were well taken care of by J! Fort Greene is an amazing area close to the city but quiet, lush (at least in May) and full of great places to eat. The apartment is on one of the nicest streets in the area, close to everything but still peaceful. It was very clean, beautifully renovated, the bed was comfy and the kitchen perfect for our needs - which was breakfast, because honestly, if you are in NYC to visit you should eat out as much as possible. The garden is lovely and was perfect for breakfast or for drinks in the evening. Highly recomended!"
2060,7097,52544,6/13/10,115085,Louis,"J made us feel at home instantly.  The townhouse is airy, bright, and VERY clean. The top floor was a comfortable and roomy getaway.  We hope to return."

2065,7097,92744,9/7/10,217886,Dan,"i stayed on the top floor, which had beautiful light. Everything was clean and new, the place felt like a fancy hotel. J is an excellent host.  I would certainly stay here again.  The neighborhood is safe and full of great places to eat and useful stores, and a nice park. I wish I lived there. 5 stars without hesitation."
2066,7097,94255,9/10/10,204079,John,"My wife and I stayed in the garden apartment for three days and we could not have been more pleased.  J made it very easy to get in and get ourselves comfortable.  The WiFi worked great, the bed was comfortable, and the shower is fantastic.  This is a spacious place with your own entrance, the rooms are clean, and the sleeping is at the back where the overhead fan makes it even more likely that you will sleep peacefully.  We needed to set the alarm to get up in the morning â€” it's that quiet.  We would be glad to stay here again, in fact, we will make this our first choice the next time we're in Brooklyn."
2067,7097,95497,9/12/10,126900,Judy,"Even though I would not recognize her from her photo, the person we met was lovely, as was her apartment, conveniently located in a beautiful part of Brooklyn, and so quiet that we overslept! We hope to stay there again on future trips."
2068,7097,97348,9/14/10,209761,Pat,"Beautiful, quality rooms and garden, in a lovely neighborhood; so much nicer than a top notch hotel room. Convenient to subway. Owner is practical and helpful but not intrusive.   A great way to experience Brooklyn brownstone living at it's best. We will be back."
2069,7097,100582,9/19/10,229480,Dennis,"We rented the top-floor space and found it beautiful, spacious, and very clean- and just around the corner from many excellent bars, restaurants and cafes. Conveniently located to several subway stops.J was also an excellent host and made the entire transaction easy and worry-free. We'll definitely be back."
2070,7097,102337,9/21/10,141393,Jason,"We spent two nights in the beautiful Garden Apartment, and we didn't want to leave.  The apartment was spacious, clean, comfortable, and thoughtfully decorated.  We really enjoyed the large garden in the back--quiet and peaceful.  The host J. was great, very friendly and accomodating, giving us helpful info on everything.  We would most definitely stay here again.  "
2071,7097,104150,9/24/10,134758,Eihway,"The top floor is gorgeous and very clean. The photos don't adequately show the charm and spaciousness of the place. There is a beautiful stained glass skylight in the landing area and a small room that is connected to the bedroom by French doors that has the closet and dresser as well as an additional window. The ""laundry room"" is also on the top floor and looks more like a dining room with a big table and chairs and was only used by me. The place was very quiet with a view through the trees outside of the other brownstones on the block. The neighborhood is very attractive with restaurants and stores.J was very responsible. "
2072,7097,110795,10/3/10,247238,Kate,"My stay at J's place could not have been better (stayed on the third floor).  It's gorgeous and much bigger than the pictures make it seem.  There's a kitchen-like room with a table and chairs (though just a sink, no fridge or stove/microwave), a beautiful bathroom, a bedroom and a dressing room off to the side.  Plenty of natural light through windows and skylights and very tastefully decorated.  It was an absolute pleasure to be there.  Feels very private even though people are living downstairs.  We neither heard nor saw anyone until we were literally walking out the door to leave.  However, J made it known that we could reach if we needed anything.  Would return in a heartbeat.  Thanks, J!    "

We appreciated everything from the coffe beans and coffee grinder to the wine glasses.  We hope J's place is available if we go to NYC again!"
2075,7097,133387,11/4/10,255286,Jim,"J's place worked out perfectly for our stay.  We walked to wine shops, restaurants, my daughter's apartment... It was a perfect location for us.  The apartment was quite nice.  J even had a coffee grinder and whole bean coffee in the room for us.  On our 1st stay in Brooklyn we stayed at the Nu Hotel.  It was nice, however, the price, room, comfort and location of J's place was a MUCH better option!  Thanks J!"
2076,7097,149571,12/6/10,288974,Beth And Anish,Excellent stay. Beautiful building with five-star furnishings. Great interactions with the host. Fun neighborhood. We're true believers!

2079,7097,334708,6/26/11,460217,Jennifer,"What an amazing place to stay (we were in the garden apartment)... the rooms are of a generous size and the quality of the furnishings and design work is of an extremely high standard.  The garden is such a treat to have, especially in a big city like NYC.  The kitchenette was perfect for making tea and had plenty of useful dishes, glasses, utensils, et cetera.  The bed was large and comfortable, the television is huge, the shower is powerful and gorgeous and J was so helpful and responsive to any questions - we had total privacy while we were staying in the apartment, but she left us her number so we could ring her if we needed anything.  It is such a wonderful place to stay, so much nicer than a hotel - we would definitely go back and will recommend to all our friends.  "
2080,7097,452437,8/16/11,962212,Natalie,"Nice/safe location. We had the whole top floor and it was lovely. Very clean and nicely decorated. Had a kitchen area, own bathroom with a deep tub, and a separate room area for the closet. It felt very roomy and made you forget you were in the busy crowed area of Brooklyn. "

We will definitely look to use this location again for future visits!"
2083,7097,509524,9/6/11,1015343,Ignasi,"We were in the garden flat. Great and adorable place in a quiet neibourhood in Brooklyn. The subway is quite close. Safe. Jay is a good person. I recommend it 100%.Thanks Jay for all!!"
2084,7097,527572,9/13/11,814715,Susan,My visit to NYC was wonderful. I love Fort Greene! Jay's apt  is lovely and cozy. The apt is a couple of blocks from the subway and an easy ride to the city. I will stay again!

2088,7097,1020817,3/19/12,1736762,Sheila,"This garden apartment was lovely, with interesting appointments throughout and careful attention to decor. I stayed 4 nights, and enjoyed being able to work in the apartment. The weather two of the days in March was nice enough to sit and work outside. J was very accommodating, prompt in responding to any questions or needs, and flexible on check in and out."
2089,7097,1254157,5/9/12,2154544,Mary,"Pros: Good location within walking distance of many good restaurants along Dekalb. Seven blocks to G or C subway. The bathroom is large and well lighted. The apartment is large.Cons: Bed is uncomfortable. Second mattress atop sleeper sofa is foam, it's mushy, soft, worn-out, has a tendency to roll you to the middle, not good with two adults. Sheets, bedding are showing signs of wear, pulled off around corners every night. Would give this place more stars if the bed was better and for the price per night it should be better. The back yard chairs and tables were very dirty and could not be used."
2090,7097,1275945,5/14/12,902420,Kaden,"Very private fairly spacious flat. Lovely garden was a major plus over a beautiful weekend. Wonderful location, close to everything! The only reason I'm not giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because the bed is on a pull out frame, so it may not be comfy sleeping for everyone, but we slept fine and truly enjoyed 2 nights at the apt. We plan on being repeat visitors!"
2091,7097,1317760,5/21/12,391806,Claudia,We had a delightful stay at Perfect for Parents visiting family in Clinton Hill.

2093,7097,2538472,10/8/12,3353828,Charlotta,As advertised.  My mother and sister stayed there for my wedding  in early October and had a great time.  The garden is beautiful.  The kitchen area is lovely.  Everything was clean.  It is my favorite neighborhood in Brooklyn.  I'm sure my relatives will stay again.  Jay is very helpful.
2094,7097,2607708,10/14/12,3583339,Dan,We had a very pleasant experience at Jay Al's place.  Jay Al was an excellent host and the apartment is as seen in the pictures.  No complaints whatsoever!!!

There was plenty of room to spread out.  The little sunroom doubling as a place to snack and make coffee or tea was so cozy.The neighborhood is beautiful, close to subways, little cafes and restaurants.  Fort Greene was made a historical landmark in the late 70s so history is present and thick. "

The neighborhood is lovely, lots of brunch places within 1 to 2 blocks and an amazing coffee shop 1/2 block away. Fort green park is a short walk, we spent a few hours just roaming around the neighborhood.  I highly recommend this apartment. We had an excellent time! "

2102,7097,5191736,6/17/13,2573256,Wayne,"We've been travelling to NYC/Brooklyn for over 13 years.  We've never had two nights as quiet and peaceful as the two we spent here.  The neighborhood is quiet, yet close to anything one could want in entertainment, food or necessities.  The garden is beautiful (but you do have to be careful as there is some poison iv y growing).  As long as our family lives in the area, we will try again to stay here."
2103,7097,5736333,7/14/13,4326843,Alexandra,"This is a great space-- quiet and private and actually very lovely. We particularly enjoyed being able to go out and sit in the garden when the weather was good-- it's so unusual to have your own private green space in NYC! Also quite convenient to a number of trains, and such an adorable neighborhood. "
2104,7097,5860358,7/20/13,5693097,Mariana,"It was a wonderful place for our holidays. Everything excellent, we felt at home. Exquisite details on decoration and attention. The appartment is private and located in a very nice neighbourhood, near the subway and some good restaurants.We were received by a very nice and kind woman, who was always available for us, and offered us help, information and advice, very useful to enjoy the amazing New York city. Thank you!!!"
2105,7097,6459687,8/13/13,1554514,Sandy,A very lovely apartment that suited our needs perfectly! Highly recommended.
2106,7097,7284042,9/14/13,8187197,Rob,"Best place in Fort Greene neighborhood, and not just for the money, all around. The location is prime with all the great shops, cafÃ©s and restaurants within walking distance (I recommend Dekalb Ave. and Myrtle Ave.) This is one of the nicest and safest neighborhoods in I have stayed in in Brooklyn. Oh, and a cool Farmers Market in the Forte Green park every Sat. Jane was phenomenal. She made early morning accommodations to meet me upon check in and gave a bright eyed and bushy tailed tour of the place. Everything was super nice, loved the decor and it was very very clean...spotless! There is also a private outdoor patio that most people in Brooklyn would kill to have... "
2107,7097,7674813,9/29/13,4692935,Polina,"We stayed at Jane's place at the end of September and really enjoyed this garden suite. The place was very clean, nicely decorated and spacious, with access to a pretty garden and patio outside. The house is located on a beautiful and quiet street and is close to many great restaurants and shops. Jane was accommodating and responsive to all our requests. The only thing to be mindful of is that the bed is actually a pull out couch. We found it rather comfortable nonetheless."
2108,7097,8093822,10/15/13,5375087,Catherine,"We had a great stay at this apartment!  Everything went very smoothly--we felt bad having been delayed in transit, but Jane met us with the key and explained everything very graciously despite the late hour.  It was a nice set-up--a separate ground floor apartment with its own entrance, but the owner lived in the building, so we felt like it was easy to be in touch with her if we needed anything.  As it happened, the place was great and we didn't need any help.  The apartment is nicely decorated and very homey.  We liked the huge bathroom and the views of the pretty garden.  We were nervous about the sofabed, but it turned out to be very comfortable, and we slept very well each night.  Fort Greene is a gorgeous neighborhood full of classic brownstones, and though we'd lived in New York before, exploring this area was a whole new adventure.  The park is a short block from the apartment, and it is lovely.  We also walked to Brooklyn Flea and many great restaurants in the neighborhood.  There is quite a brunch scene around! (Our favorite place we tried may have been Cafe Paulette, with its classic French atmosphere--it is only a few weeks old!) We also walked to Park Slope a few times, another lively neighborhood which is not too far.  Just be aware that most metro lines are a 10-15 minute walk--it was totally fine for us, and we spent most of our time in Brooklyn, but just know that getting to Manhattan is not a matter of a few minutes, if that is important to you.We had a great stay and would highly recommend this apartment!  It was comfortable and left us well-positioned to explore one of New York's most charming neighborhoods."
2109,7097,8406247,10/29/13,8655173,Helen,"We had a wonderful time!  The space is private and lovely - the garden gives it an airy, even larger feel. J. was there to greet us, knows the neighborhood and was very accommodating.  We are looking forward to our next visit."

2111,7097,8907441,11/25/13,9751803,David,"AirbnbFantastic place for enjoying Brooklyn â€_ or even Manhattan since itâ€™s close to transit.We drove in from Virginia and found parking within a few spots of the door in mid-afternoon. (Left the car parked there the rest of the weekend, but noticed a regular turnover of parking spots.)Space is tastefully done, quiet â€_ and really spacious. This is not a hotel room or a suite â€“ itâ€™s a full apartment. I enjoyed having coffee in the rocker in the kitchen/sun room every morning. (Thereâ€™s coffee to be made or you can dash down to the corner and buy two bagels and two coffees for less than $5. We bought.)The only hitch was the bed, which J. clearly states is a sofa bed. I slept (and napped) like a rock. My wife, who is half my size, complained that she kept rolling into me. Lesson for all of you: Donâ€™t sleep with me.We sampled the neighborhood restaurants, all very good, and strolled through Fort Greene park people watching New Yorkers being surprisingly normal. Too cold for garden, but we enjoyed looking out at it. It must be spectacular in the spring.Never used Airbnb before. Weâ€™ll be back. And we'll be back to Perfect for Parents, With Garden."
2112,7097,9019883,12/2/13,7057679,Corynne,"J. was very accommodating and answered all the questions we had before and during the stay. The room was convenient, clean, and cozy. I booked this room for my parents and they were very comfortable there. Thanks, J.! "

2114,7097,13085634,5/19/14,14167806,Patricia,"My kids planned a weekend in Brooklyn in April 2013 to celebrate my 50th birthday  My daughter and I stayed here, and loved it so much, we came back again on May 16/17/18, 2014, to visit my son, who lives near by. The apartment is lovely, comfortable, and well furnished. The garden is beautiful and we enjoyed coffee, cocktails, and long conversations there. This neighborhood has great coffee shops and restaurants, and is within walking distance of Fort Greene Park. We especially love the Brooklyn Flea, Cafe Paulette, and Bergen Bagels. J. is a thoughtful and considerate host. We are already planning another visit for late October. "
2115,7097,13278072,5/24/14,13984386,Sebastian,"J.'s Apartment ist ein wunderbarer RÃ_ckzugsort nach einem langen Tag in Manhattan. Die ruhige Strasse und der grÃ_ne Innenhof wirken nach den hektischen GrosstadteindrÃ_cken sehr erholsam. Die nahe gelegene Dekalb Ave bietet eine Vielzahl an guten und abwechselungsreichen Restaurants. Wir haben uns in der geschmackvoll eingerichteten und gemÃ_tlichen Wohnung sehr wohl gefÃ_hlt."
2116,7097,13420333,5/27/14,9720260,Betsy,"Our stay was outstanding! We loved visiting with our two Brooklyn sons on the back patio among the rhododendrons. The shower was one of the best I've ever had, the bed was comfortable, and morning coffee at the Red Lantern/Bike Shop was just two blocks away. "
2117,7097,13694388,6/2/14,15434486,Jackie,We stayed here while visiting family in Fort Greene.  Location was perftect - close to the park and restaurants on Dekalb and Lafayette.  The apartment was very large and clean and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay! J was very easy to work with.
2118,7097,13982368,6/9/14,8585134,Andrea,J's home is on a beautiful quiet street in Brooklyn. She was easy to communicate with and completely flexible about check in and check out times. The house is spacious and has everything you need. The back garden is beautiful and a nice change of pace for NYC. We loved staying here and would do it again!
2119,7097,14806502,6/26/14,8216975,Sean,J was a very nasty and negative person. From the first moment we met I felt I had to go out of my way to be nice just to get her to feel more comfortable with me. Her place is nice I will say that but she is the only person I have ever had a problem with in my entire airbnb experience! 
2120,7097,19204029,9/8/14,14785245,Laurie,Yes i felt welcome and the location is perfect!  The home is gorgeous and well appointed.
2121,7097,21661032,10/21/14,3609875,Holly,"This is a very comfortable and quiet apartment in a great Brooklyn location, close to restaurants, bars, coffee, trains, and Fort Greene Park. The owner was very accommodating to our schedule and made sure we had everything we need. The apartment is large, the bed is comfortable, and the garden is private and relaxing. And all on a beautiful tree-lined street. A great choice."
2122,7097,21814061,10/24/14,7534737,Jeff,"J's place was fantastic!  Cool neighborhood, great apartment.  J was very accommodating on my arrival time.  Thank you!"
2123,7097,21905154,10/26/14,15106844,Bert,"Super location in pretty neighborhood. The garden provided a quiet retreat. J. was kind enough to rush home to greet us when we arrived earlier than expected. The place and experience were perfect for parents, indeed."
2124,7097,23994091,12/16/14,22920004,Charles,"J is a welcoming and gracious host. The accommodations are exactly as described, and actually much better when experienced.  The apartment we had was the bottom floor of an exquisite brownstone, located in the middle of the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. What we really liked, is the easy access to other parts of New York via the subway.  Easy walking distance to the Q (at DeKalb and Flatbush) which goes right to mid-town; the A&C (at Metro Tech) which goes right up 8th avenue through Times Square; and the G (at various stops) which goes to Queens through the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.  Plenty of restaurants and coffee nooks for meals and bagels within easy walking distance.  J was easy to communicate with, and went out of her way to help us out when needed it.  This is an A-one stop for a New York visit."
2125,7097,24776788,1/2/15,24916681,Joe,"This is a great place to stay!  My wife and I stayed here for 2 days, over New Yearâ€™s, while visiting friends just a few blocks away.  We drove in and there was plenty of free on-street parking. We arrived early and found a great place to have a cup of tea and a bit to eat before our host arrived, exactly when she said she would (J was very easy to coordinate with).   The place is beautiful â€“ just like in the pictures.  The bed is quite comfortable.  As an insomniac, I was worried about the sofa bed, but I had no trouble sleeping.  The kitchen was perfect for what we needed (microwave, sink, coffee pot) â€“ just keep in mind there is no oven or stove top. The neighborhood is fantastic, with plenty of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. I wish we were there in warmer weather to enjoy the garden. My wife and I highly recommend this place!"
2126,7097,25544954,1/19/15,13104928,Marci,"Our host was on site when we arrived and showed us around the apartment, pointing out specific things that would be good to know during our stay.  The apartment was nicely decorated and had everything we needed.  The location was terrific, right near our son and daughter-in-law, who live in Fort Greene.  We were able to walk easily to their apartment, to BAM, Prospect Park, and Pratt Institute.  We really enjoyed our stay and hope to come again."
2127,7097,27442804,3/4/15,7932698,Matthew,Great place! Warm and spacious for Brooklyn - has nice garden out back. Good location near the park and not too far from subways. Really enjoyed staying here and my father liked it as well. 
2128,7097,29799886,4/12/15,1483390,Shaun,"J was very accommodating for my mom's recent stay in Brooklyn. The apartment was exactly as described: a very well kept, beautifully decorated and clean apartment in a lovely brownstone with a backyard garden. We especially enjoyed the location - right around the corner from Fort Greene Park and walking distance to a wide variety of restaurants, cafes, and, if you're around on a Saturday, the farmers market and Brooklyn Flea Market. Thanks J! "
2129,7097,31672608,5/8/15,16837547,Genna,"Lovely garden apartment in great location in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Clean and spacious! The bed was a pull-out couch but very comfortable. Towels were fluffy, shower pressure was super strong, bathroom was spotless; bring your own shampoo. I'm already booked for my next business trip to NYC!"
2130,7097,32809479,5/22/15,25269953,Brad,"This space is not only perfect for parents but for anyone wishing to stay in Brooklyn.  We were warmly welcomed by J., the host.  This home is a carefully restored Civil War era Victorian Brownstone.  It is worth a visit to enjoy the interior.  We stayed in the bottom level which has three rooms including the bedroom  There is a kitchen area with windows that look out on a private garden.The location is convenient with easy access to local restaurants, markets, and the subway.  We found our visit was enhanced as we were able to experience some of the local Brooklyn  culture.  It is within easy walking distance of Pratt Institute."

2132,7097,34144909,6/5/15,16837547,Genna,"Clean and spacious in a great area. There is now a real queen bed rather than a pull out, which is great. "
2133,7097,36334017,6/27/15,29533679,Cez,"J was very welcoming and helpful.Communication was great.The apartment is in a perfect location - there are some amazing restaurants and bars around and it's close to the park and subway.The apartment is quiet and peaceful.All in all an wonderful stay.Thanks!"

2135,7097,43424446,8/19/15,9521049,J,"Nice location on a quiet street.  Apartment is located on the bottom floor of a charming brownstone with access to a nice garden in the back.  The set up is a bit different than the pictures (bedroom is where the living room is pictured and living room is where the bedroom is pictured) but that does not affect the quality of the stay in fact enhances it as the room in the front can be darker for better sleep in spite of being on the street side.  There is a real bed (not sofabed).  Very nice and modern bathroom adjacent to the bedroom.  Kitchen facilities were perfect for us; small refrigerator, microwave, sink and coffee maker.  Guests should be more mindful of future guests by leaving clean cups and silverware (we found coffee cups put back like they were clean but were not - the host should not have to inspect every cup, plate and piece of silverware on departure of every guest).Wifi worked very well for us and there were lots of channels available on the tv.Several Metro stops close by; getting into the city center is very easy. Nice diverse neighborhood where we felt quite safe walking home later in the evenings.Host is very accessible if you need her and kindly offered the use of laundry facilities when requested.  We found several excellent restaurants within walking distance of the apartment and lucked out on arrival to find a parking spot right out front.This was our first Airbnb experience; we would recommend staying here and hope to visit again."
2136,7097,46017263,9/7/15,41763679,Mary,"We enjoyed staying in this comfortable, spacious, clean unit. J. was entirely accommodating, and it was fun to be walking in the neighborhood and see our host out and about too. This is a great location, super close to Fort Greene Park, but also within walking distance of the Brooklyn Navy Yard (interesting guided tours) and just a bit farther, Brooklyn Bridge Park (fantastic views, great public spaces). Downtown Brooklyn and the subway are not far. There are plenty of interesting restaurants close by. Hope to visit again!"
2137,7097,46706290,9/13/15,1474700,Josh,J. was great! She was super accommodating and flexible as I had some communication problems with my parents at first. Her place was absolutely perfect for my parents. The location doesn't get much better for Ft. Greene and my mom is already talking about how she wants to come back. I highly recommend staying here. 
2138,7097,47854348,9/21/15,42463388,Seungbum,"I had a great time with nice host and cozy house and town."
2139,7097,48043200,9/22/15,44090655,Jennifer,The place was cute.  I wish I had more time to spend in the apartment itself. It was a great place for what I needed. The shower was awesome. 
2140,7097,49023522,9/30/15,4880972,Marty,"My mother and I had a lovely stay. J. met me when I arrived and gave me a tour and orientation of the apartment. Everything was as described - no surprises. It was tastefully decorated and well-maintained. The neighborhood is great - centrally located with lots of restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores, and Fort Greene park is a block away. We would definitely stay here again."
2141,7097,49767582,10/6/15,1785267,Antonia,"This was a beautiful, spacious place in a very nice neighborhood.  J. has decorated this so well and created a space that seems homey without being too obviously someone else's actual living space. Because she lives upstairs, you are not dealing with someone else's clothes and toiletries which often seems too intimate and invasive.  We did not need her help for anything since our son lives in the neighborhood but she seemed like she would be available if we had. We did not use the outdoor space but it looked lovely.  We would definitely stay here again."
2142,7097,50291277,10/11/15,8640802,J,"Perfect for Us!  We have stayed in ""Perfect for Parents"", private upper floor, as well as ""Perfect for Grandparents"", private entrance garden apartment.    Both accommodations are architecturally pleasing, quiet, with comfortable bed(s), while providing all the amenities (restaurants, farmer's market, neighborhood parking, access to subway) of Fort Greene area.   J. was very accommodating and helpful during our stays!  Whenever we go to Brooklyn we keep our fingers crossed that ""Perfect for Parents"" or ""Perfect for Grandparents"" will be available!  Just stay here!"

The space was very open and felt like a home away from home. I maintained contact by email and when I returned ""home"" each night, she had fulfilled mu requests. The apartment is very quiet and in a good neighborhood...near restaurants, a great farmer's market and...near my son and his family. "

The apartment was large and very comfortable and very clean The host was kind enough to let us leave our luggage late into the afternoon of our departure day.  We liked the neighborhood. It is  quiet residential.  We would go there again. "
2147,7097,54152373,11/16/15,13441114,Zander,"An excellent place to stay! The apartment is very spacious and comfortable.

2148,7097,55404688,12/1/15,7921907,Russ,This is the second time that I've stayed here and everything was as smooth and professional as the first time. The location is great with lots of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. The home is very comfortable too.
2149,7097,67562674,3/30/16,9144341,Jill,We loved the neighborhood.  We have traveled many times to Brooklyn and this is one of our favorite neighborhoods to stay in.  The apartment was convenient to many of the restaurants we like and also to our son's apartment.  It was very quiet at night and we loved that.  The apartment was comfortable and nicely decorated.  We would definitely recommend this apartment to others.
2150,7097,68359572,4/4/16,37514663,Nitya,"J. was a wonderful host, our every need was taken care of."
2151,7097,70293894,4/17/16,65837519,Vincent,J.was welcoming and very helpful with information about the neighborhood and how to make our way around the city. Our spacious rooms were in a beautiful art filled brownstone on a quiet street in a charming neighborhood. Parking was easy and there were excellent restaurants within walking distance. The beds were comfortable and the large garden area in the back was a great place to sit and relax in the afternoon. We look forward to returning. 
2152,7097,71276280,4/24/16,62037175,Sara,"J. was a great host. Checking in and out was a breeze, and any questions we had were answered quickly. The pictures are accurate, and the place was beautiful, clean and comfortable during our stay."

2157,7097,97756963,8/28/16,17927284,Keith,"The neighborhood is vibrant and a little funky.  It was Afro-punk weekend, which contributed.Our host was available and willing to chat, and ""stoop-sit.""   It's a very nice apartment and garden, very comfortable. "

2162,7097,105660835,10/2/16,96100915,Casey,"This was our first stay with Airbnb and it set the bar pretty high. We were given a tour upon arrival to make us aware of all the amenities. The accommodations were warm and inviting, the mini fridge came in quite handy, and the shower was excellent. The television was big and cable was provided, but we were too busy with our trip to need this feature. Although the weather was quite gloomy, the outside garden area looked very welcoming. The bed was on the firmer side for my tastes, but my husband had no issue with it."
2163,7097,106321421,10/5/16,346611,Nazanin,Jane was super accommodating. She met us later in the evening when we were able to arrive and she was so incredibly sweet and caring with my kids. This place is really perfect for parents though and I would definitely book it again.

Even though it does not come with a full kitchen, which we knew - J offered them to use the kitchen upstairs. J responded quickly and answered all our questions and was flexible in our arrival time. I will plan on requesting her place on subsequent visits and would recommend it to anyone."

2168,7097,114892595,11/20/16,22571213,Dawn,"Our accommodations were on a quiet street in Ft Greene, handy to the Ft Greene Park, restaurants, cafes, and shops.  Our rooms were large and elegantly furnished; the kitchen small but perfectly functional; and the garden peaceful and calm. For a couple this is a great place to stay for weeks on end; but if others are  with you sleeping on the fold out couch in the other room, it is a bit awkward as the shared bath is off the master bedroom.This is a lovely, stately, comfortable place to retreat to whilst in NYC.  Highly recommended."
2169,7097,120316788,12/9/16,17292723,Allison,"Had a wonderful time a J's place. Very spacious, amazingly comfortable bed, and she everything we needed. Safe, quiet neighborhood, amazing location. Great restaurants and coffee nearby. Also would be great for anyone who can't handle many stairs-- it's garden level, so it's two steps down and that's it. Definitely would stay there again."
2170,7097,123285908,12/28/16,9583338,Jane,"We have stayed here three  times, for a week each time. It is everything you could ask for in a getaway. It is homey, very spacious and beautifully decorated. The kitchen is on the opposite end of the space so you don't have to creep around in the morning if someone is sleeping. And you couldn't ask for a nicer host. The neighborhood is lovely, interesting and people are very friendly. You can easily walk to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in ten minutes, where we saw three first run movies. There are plenty of bars and restaurants and you are close to Fort Greene Park and public transport. You won't be disappointed!"
2171,7097,131080748,2/10/17,17292723,Allison,"This is our second time staying with J and, as seems to be a theme, everything was perfect."

2185,7097,181362994,8/12/17,5041378,Whitnie,"J's place was, as advertised, great for parents! My MIL and Brother in law were in town to meet our new baby so we needed something close (we live in downtown Brooklyn) and spacious. The location was ideal and J was an exceptional host. She met me in person to give me the lay of the land, which offered plenty of space for the two of them. J had an extra room available at the time of their stay and graciously offered it as well at no extra charge. The garden was a big part of why we booked the place, and it was gorgeous. J had warned me ahead of time about the mosquitoes...I would recommend bringing repellent if booking in the summertime, they were pretty aggressive! Overall very happy with J's place and her generous hospitality. "
2186,7097,187704341,8/27/17,121078214,Grace,great place to stay! Super cute and super attentive host!
2187,7097,190574705,9/4/17,7837770,Delbra,J's place is the perfect place for us to stay when we visit our daughter in Brooklyn.  J is quick to respond and helpful with any questions.  We hope to stay there again in the future.
2188,7097,192940765,9/11/17,4153911,David,"J's place is spacious, homey and nicely decorated. Good communication with host and the neighborhood is great. Definitely a great home base if you are wanting to stay in Brooklyn. Loved it and felt very much at home."
2189,7097,193455562,9/13/17,341198,Alexandra,"The home is a comfortable, clean, large space with a lovely garden space. It is well decorated to feel like a warm home. Amazing water pressure and comfortable bed and seating. It's in an ideal location-- on a leafy, brownstone-lined street, in walking distance to restaurants, the park, and the subway.  A great way to experience Fort Greene and beyond."
2190,7097,197718638,9/26/17,118524285,Tasha,"J, was a great host! The apartment was just what I and my husband needed. The location couldn't have been any better."
2191,7097,203200454,10/14/17,28318682,Lexi,"This was EXACTLY what we needed. My family is scattered about Manhattan and Brooklyn, and when we come back to visit we really need to be in a central location that is a spacious ""home base"" for us. This location is the best! It's central to all the best places in the neighborhood and it's so easy to get into the city.  We generally don't spend that much time in the actual place, but this was perfect for coming in, relaxing, and having a comfy place to do our morning routine and sleep.1) the bed is huge and comfy...and you should set an alarm if you need to wake up early because it gets SUPER dark. We slept so late the first morning because it was so cozy.2) note that there is a kitchenette--no stove, but a coffee maker, and J. had a bunch of take out utensils and stuff like that for anything we might bring in. There's also a yard that we didn't have the time to use, but it's there. 3) the wifi isn't as strong in the living room as in the bedroom, and my husband had to do work, but there is a couch in the bedroom so he was able to work in there. J. was super responsive and helpful with check in and check out. We'll be back.Thank you!"
2192,7097,206464976,10/25/17,93212382,Jaymie,This was the perfect place for our visit to NY. Not far from the subway to get to the tourist spots of the city - absolutely beautiful walks.  The garden was like youâ€™re own private Central Park. J was a wonderful host and made us feel at home.
2193,7097,212991921,11/19/17,12762861,Alexis,J's place in Fort Greene is SO lovely and comfortable. A beautifully decorated and accommodating space in one of my favorite parts of Brooklyn. Would stay here again!

2197,7097,220941666,12/24/17,988597,Gail,"J's space is terrific.  The king bed is comfortable and the bathroom is roomy by NY standards.  The amenities you hope for in a place to stay ""away from home"" are there.  Quiet street ... great location ... all good!"
2198,7097,223584504,1/1/18,9094634,Jon,Short walk to subway and ride into Manhattan. Plenty of local options to eat. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Easy to find on street parking.
2199,7097,234110598,2/11/18,169962131,Abby,Great location - a minute's walk to Ft. Greene park and wonderful restaurants and coffee shops.  Easy to get to public transit.  Beautiful brownstone full of interesting art work and books.  Comfortable and cozy sitting area and private kitchenette.  Modern bathroom.  Quiet neighborhood.
2200,7097,238688012,2/26/18,15736837,Diedra,"Great place in a great location.  This is the little downstairs apartment you wish you had when out of town family comes to stay. Warm, homey, and just a block in either direction to everything you need. J was so very accommodating in every way. She was there for our late night check in and totally flexible with check out time. Thank you thank you for sharing your home with us."
2201,7097,244337264,3/18/18,12762861,Alexis,"This was our second time staying at Jane's airbnb and both times were excellent! She was very accommodating with flexible check-in and check-out times, and the house is SO beautiful. We will surely be staying again the next time my parents are in Brooklyn!"
2202,7097,248439391,3/31/18,25687816,Christine,Jane was very helpful and responsed quickly. Easy check-in and check-out and we could even put our bags in her apartment until we left for the airport. The apartment is very pretty and quiet. Nice neighbourhood with cafÃ©s and restaurant. Subway is close (3 different stations) and gets you almost anywhere. Overall a great place from which to explore Brooklyn and the rest of New York!
2203,7097,249995315,4/3/18,104249483,Tina,"Janeâ€™s place is a lovely garden level space in her beautiful brownstone. The bed was very comfortable and the living area was great for relaxing. Her place is super close to Fort Green park, coffee shops, great restaurants and the subway. She is a great hostess. She is easily available, friendly, and itâ€™s evident that she cares about the comfort of her guests. We would definitely stay here again."
2204,7097,254386547,4/16/18,54760629,Jose Antonio,El departamento estÃ¡ muy bien con un jardÃ_n muy agradable . Bien ubicado y Jane es buena anfitriona
2205,7097,257811721,4/27/18,14433882,Michael,"We were so lucky to stay in a place as beautiful as Janeâ€™s. You couldnâ€™t ask for a more beautiful interior, to get the complete historic Brooklyn experience. And the space is huge - the big bedroom, the en suite, the living room, and terrific kitchen looking out onto the beautiful back garden which is a wonderful and peaceful oasis (which you may well need after escaping from Manhattan).Outside, the apartment is on a quiet street of Brownstones, but only a couple of minutes walk from great coffee shops, restaurants, bars, train stations, and the tranquility of Fort Greene Park.Most of all, Jane is a wonderful host - wonderful tips and thoughts on what to do in the neighbourhood, and being amazingly helpful in letting us store our luggage.Weâ€™d stay here again in a flash, and would absolutely recommend this amazing apartment to anyone.Thanks Jane - canâ€™t wait to see you again soon!"
2206,7097,266852503,5/20/18,57051881,Tatjana,"Jane's place was the absolute best place that we could have stayed in Brooklyn. It was located near 3 subway stations so it was very accessible from the airport(s) and it was also super easy to get around Brooklyn and to Manhattan. The apartment was cozy and clean with a really nice kitchenette. Jane was very prompt in responding to messages and was very welcoming when we arrived. In a beautiful neighbourhood near lots of coffee shops, restaurants, and parks!"
2207,7097,268612031,5/25/18,3046303,Sarah,"Jane's place was great - a great location, and clean, spacious, and comfortable for my husband and I and our 7-month-old. Jane was very responsive when we asked about check-in and check-out procedures. We didn't end up using it much, but the garden was beautiful, too!"
2208,7097,269519217,5/27/18,51206850,Patricia,A wonderful place to stay if you want a feeling of what Brooklyn used to be and is now.
2209,7097,272956783,6/4/18,14472211,Steve,"As advertised, it was a great place for my parents to stay while visiting. Jane was very responsive and accommodating."

From start to finish, Jane was great at communicating with us to ensure that our weekend stay was everything we needed."
2211,7097,278688888,6/18/18,70679890,Zan,"Beautiful apartment in the Fort Greene neighborhood. A very short walk from the park, subways, and many fantastic restaurants (get brunch at Olea, especially the eggs + salmon or the French toast that includes seseme seeds). After spending the day in Manhattan, I very much enjoyed sitting in the quiet backyard with lovely trees and ivy for an hour. The backyard is also quite visible from the living room and mini-kitchen, which makes the whole place feel like a great oasis. Only small thing was that the wifi  was a bit slow, at least in the bedroom. Ooh...on the plus side, also a very nice bathroom and shower. Easy to walk or hop on a Citibike to nearby neighborhoods too. Hosts we're very responsive and easy to coordinate arrival with. Overall we really liked our stay in Brooklyn, and definitely feel like this place was a part of that."
2212,7097,282175974,6/26/18,158294026,Cathy,"Jane is a great host - she checked in with us during our visit to make sure we had everything we needed,  The flat is lovely, the street quiet, the neighborhood and park vey nice - a great respite from the hustle bustle of the city for those of us visiting from more rural areas!  We'd definitely stay with Jane again if the opportunity presents itself."

2215,7097,296778741,7/26/18,15566765,Ashleigh,Jane is a fantastic hostess. She was very responsive and helpful. She has a beautiful place in Ft Greene.

2217,7097,309049174,8/17/18,38754802,Margarethe,Great place. Comfortable and private. Very kind host who will anticipate your needs. 
2218,7097,314931632,8/27/18,7859816,Lexi,This is a quaint place with a ton of character. Great value and awesome location! Recommend 
2219,7097,321598129,9/10/18,1785267,Antonia,"This is our second stay here because it is in such a lovely area near Fort Greene Park (and around the corner from our son's place).  It is really comfortable and stylish and Jane is great at helping you (personally welcomed us in case we had questions, gave us late check out, etc.) and the place is very roomy with a living room and garden out back.  The small kitchen is fine for breakfast with small fridge, microwave, kettle and coffee maker and she offers a kitchen upstairs if you contact her.  Also, she has laundry facilities upstairs.  I definitely recommend this place as a lovely spot in one of Brooklyn's nicest areas."
2220,7097,325418150,9/19/18,69726270,Jenny,"Jane biedt een basement aan, dus je komt in een kelderverdieping. Met ramen boven de grond en een tuin aan het gelijkvloers achteraan. De locatie is schitterend: rustig, groen en met veel ruimte. Het bed is fantastisch als je goed wil uitrusten. Je bent in Brooklyn, dus als je naar Manhattan wil moet je altijd een hele tijd metro doen. Het verblijf echter is een ware oase na de drukte van de stad. Er is bereikbaarheid naar alle kanten. Denk eraan om zeker in de DUMBO area rond te lopen: een geweldig voorbeeld van stadsvernieuwing en -uitbreiding. Brooklyn zelf verdient uitgebreide aandacht, met het Fort Greene Park dichtbij en iets verderop het prachtige Prospect Park."
2221,7097,327246976,9/23/18,41868004,Christine,Jane's place was wonderful! The space was much bigger than I expected and was extremely accommodating. Jane provided everything we needed for our weekend stay in Brooklyn.

2225,7241,18083,11/23/09,36133,Jennie,The location is great! Apartment is clean with comfy bed and good water pressure in the shower. It's in a quiet neighborhood with a subway station just around the corner. We will definitely come back - good value for money!
2226,7241,34518,4/10/10,59130,Jen,What a fabulous location and John was great!! Very prompt in his replies and gave good advice about travel links. The apartment was clean and very quiet considering it's central location. There were shops close by and a 2 minute walk to the subway. Would definitely recommend!!

2230,7241,44522,5/21/10,96605,Molly + Ryan,"awesome pad:   i don't actually want to write the great review i have in my head, 'cuz i don't want the apartment to get all popular and overcrowded and then it won't be available for EVERY time i'll be staying there AGAIN..."
2231,7241,55024,6/20/10,87340,Matthieu,"An apartment very well located which allows to visit New York in ideal conditions, a subway nearby, great bars and restaurants nearby. John is also very available. Truly a great experience."

The location is superb, the apartment charming and very clean, and John was a pleasure to deal with.  On my next NYC visit, I will make sure to arrange my travel dates to coincide with the availability of this amazing crib!"
2233,7241,60660,7/4/10,135282,Lucila,"We had a great couple of days in New York and John's apartment had a lot to do with it. He was a delight to deal with: replying to our emails, giving us directions around the neighbourhood, and making it easy to get (and leave) the keys. The apartment is quiet, clean and in a great location. And along with a fantastic book collection and stylish furniture, the AC was an added bonus since it was over 90 when we were visiting. One of Airbnb's best kept secrets!!!  "
2234,7241,66346,7/19/10,86761,James,"This place is so perfectly located,couldnt of asked for a better location, close to everything,the subway,all the restuarants and shopping.The unit was very comfortable with a very comfortable bed, great water presure in the shower, and John was the perfect host, gave all the information that I needed about the area befor he left.Thanks John, defenitaly will be back mate.James."
2235,7241,71855,8/1/10,132069,Chris,John is a great host.  The apartment is in a prime location in the picturesque West Village on the edge of the slick meatpacking district.  Subways to everywhere nearby and the Hudson River is blocks away for runners and walkers.  Truth is if you don't mind the walk up you can't beat this place.  And the walk up will keep you in good shape.  
2236,7241,76085,8/9/10,78364,Anne," The location, the apartment, and the host are all fabulous. John responds to emails quickly and is very friendly and helpful. I loved the location, wandered the neighborhoods in all directions, the subway is very close and convenient, and it was quiet for sleeping at night. I loved the decor of the space itself, vintage flower paintings and wood furniture, the raised bed next to the window where you can gaze at the city lights at night. The best thing was feeling like a local for a week. I highly recommend this place!"
2237,7241,82989,8/23/10,139370,Eduard,"Very nice apartment in an unbeatable situation in New York (west village). Friendly neighbors and tons of restaurants/shops around.John is a good host. We had some problems (which had nothing to do with him) and he did everything on his hand to solve them.I'd recommend the apartment to any couple or single person who wants to visit manhattan. It's got also a big table, which is perfect for writing (my job!)."
2238,7241,87213,8/30/10,186559,Carlos,"John was very nice and very helpful. He left several phone numbers so that we could find him for any question and at any time. The apartment is in one of my favorite neighborhoods in NYC. The bathroom is not the best because the shower doesn't meet my standards of hygiene but the apartment is bright, with a good bed, kitchen and a perfect location.John es una persona encantadora y muy servicial. Nos dejo varios nÃºmeros de telÃ©fono para que en todo momento pudiÃ©ramos lozalizarle para cualquier consulta. El apartamento estÃ¡ en uno de los barrios que mÃ¡s me gusta de NYC. El cuarto de baÃ±o no es lo mejor ya que la ducha no cumple mis estÃ¡ndares de higiene pero el apartamento tiene mucha luz, una buena cama, cocina y una localizaciÃ_n perfecta."
2239,7241,102560,9/22/10,154285,Livia + Flavio,"John is really a nice host. He's fun and even speaks portuguese!Perfect location, near the High Line Park, subway, restaurants and shops.

La cama era muy cÃ_moday estÃ¡ muy bien situado, a tan solo unos metros de la estaciÃ_n del metro y a 2 paradas de Times Square.No tuvimos el placer de conocer a John en persona pero el trato por mail y por telÃ©fono fue inmejorable, muy agradable y dispuesto a ayudar en cualquier cosa.Nos dejÃ_ las llaves en una tiendecita cerca del apartamento y sin problemas.Esperamos poder volver pronto!Gracias por todo Jhon!"
2242,7241,125711,10/24/10,244782,Tine,"John's profile is very accurate, he is certainly a mellow person. We loved to stay at his place, which will only be even cooler when the playground outside is finished. I do not hesitate to recommend this place very highly."
2243,7241,130174,10/31/10,123502,C,"AMAZING location!  The subway is so close, and there are connections to many lines.  The street is surprisingly quiet even though there are lots of great restaurants and shops nearby.  John was very helpful.  We had the BEST time!"

Can't recommend this place enough. Made our trip."
2246,7241,176989,2/1/11,253542,Mirelle,"John was very welcoming and relaxed. The apartment was a great base for our New York holiday. Very close to L train station at 14th which helped alot when it started snowing. between West Village and Meatpacking district, there are heaps of great restaurants and bars nearby. There was a couple of hitches with the apartment (wifi and building issues) which John did everything he could to sort out. Would recommend this cute, functional, well positioned studio.

2249,7241,573002,9/27/11,506422,Andreas,"A trip to New York is always a great - no matter what. But when staying in an apt as super swell as John's, it's a life changing experience.It's located perfectly in the meat packing district, a short walk from everything you will ever need. You can walk from the apt and straight into the very heart of Manhattan (think 5. avenue shopping district) within 15 minutes. There are lots of very nice restaurants and bars everywhere you walk in the neighborhood. The subways is just around the corner, not more than a five minute walk. The apt it self is very nice and clean as well. Perfect for a short and long term stay. We stayed for ten days, and it was all rosy. John was the perfect host and was very helpful in every thinkable way. He answered all our texts and e-mails promptly and was just great and friendly guy. The next time we visit NYC, we will not accept staying anywhere else than at John's place. A true gem."

It's near of a subway station, but you can go to a lot of amazing places by foot from there. The apartment is very comfortable and it has an excellent view from de bed to a little park in front of. I was there in the winter, and the heating system worked very well. John is a very interesting guy and could help us in every little problem. Besides that, he can speak spanish and some portuguese, what's may be very helpful if the guest is not so fluent english language (like me). I'd loved that place and I'll recomend, certainly."

We have already recommended the apartment to some friends who will be visiting NYC soon."

Nice to have an italian style espresso cooker, too. John is a great host, very sweet and caring, interesting and replied super fast to any questions. Overall a great experience!"
2256,7241,1301771,5/19/12,1478378,Marijke,"The best location ever between Meatpacking and West Village. Bed and shower are good. Don't expect too much of the rest, but who needs that when you're in New York."
2257,7241,1483653,6/15/12,1800706,Tomas,"John is a really wonderful host. Polite and easygoing all the time.The apartment is exactly what he says: adorable. It is very comfortable with a  home feeling. The street is beautiful and there is a park just in front. The neighborhood is the best of NY for me, with streets full of trees, small buildings and good restaurants. Next time I go to NY I will call him!Thanks John!"
2258,7241,1540494,6/23/12,1795026,Catherine,"John's place is exactly as he says. It's a fabulous little bohemian hideaway seconds from Meatpacking and all the treasures of the West Village. It's small and simple, but a perfect way to enjoy this part of the city. John was a great host, despite being away when we visited. Can highly recommend a stay at John's on Horatio!"
2259,7241,1875352,8/3/12,808757,Adam,We really appreciated the location and good communication with the host. Would stay here again. 
2260,7241,1990747,8/15/12,2003184,Sean,"really nice place in a very good position in a quiet area, but very trendy with loads of nice restaurants. John is a great host and always available in case of need."
2261,7241,2227579,9/8/12,1980943,Eva,"John was a perfect host, easy to communicate with and quick to respond to emails. The studio has everything you need if you choose to cook their own food, as happened occasionally during our two week stay. Comfortable bed and functional bathroom and shower. The apartment was bright, we liked that it was high up in the house and had a nice view. The area is superb, perhaps the coziest in Manhattan."
2262,7241,2451999,9/30/12,2513787,Pauline,"Nice and well-located place, we spent an awesome stay. You can reach in 5 min the high line or the subway.The bathroom is quite old-fashioned but clean.We enjoyed the raised bed : we keep in mind!Thank you John for your kindness and your warm welcome "
2263,7241,2585905,10/12/12,2140690,Maruja,"Excelente estadia en el departamento de John. El departamento es pequenio pero muy confortable y muy bien ubicado. El mejor barrio para vivir en NY. El edificio es muy tranquilo y la calle tambien a pesar de que a unas cuadras esta lleno de restaurantes lindisimos y el Chelsea Market, lugar imperdible.A unas cuadras hay varias estaciones de subtes con las lineas para conectarse a cualquier lugar de la ciudad.John y Cord fueron muy cordiales y solicitos. John  todo el tiempo me contesto en espanol haciendome las cosas mas faciles.Recomiendo muchisimo el departamento  y espero volver pronto. Gracias John."
2264,7241,2757989,10/30/12,2186602,Sylvia,"John's place was in a convenient location and definately felt like home! It was clean and tidy, and a pleasure to stay in.John was always very helpful and easy to communicate with! Would definately stay there again when I return to New York city!Thanks heaps!!!!!"
2265,7241,2843230,11/9/12,3203612,Sam,"This was my first experience of Airbnb.  So I was very apprehensive!  However, John was a fantistic host and very communicative throughout.  I travelled to NYC for the new york marathon which unfortunately had to be cancelled due to the after effects of hurricane sandy.  John kept me unformed prior to my arrival of the situation in the city e.g. the electric and heating problems.I arrived in manhatten with most of downtown in a blackout.  However, John arranged for his friend (Cord) to meet me at the apartment to hand over keys and show me round the place (by candlelight!).  After 2 days the electric and heating were restored which was a relief.  Although it was kinda fun to live by candlelight without TV for a while. :)Johns apartment is exactly as seen in the photos and felt like authentic new york living! The futon was very comfy and a great design which I might copy! I've stayed in manhatten a few times and i think this was by far the most quiet place i've slept.It's ideally located with restaurants, bars, shops and the underground close by.  I pretty much walked everywhere from battery park up to central park which was a great way to explore.  It's about an hour's walk to central park but if you're not as active there's 14st underground just round the corner and plenty of taxis around.Overall, I had a great stay and would definately recommend John's apartment.  I'll be using Airbnb again based on this experience."
2266,7241,2949949,11/24/12,157712,Patrick,"John was a great host and very accommodating. The apartment is in a great area, close to everything you could want from NY. Shower was great and the apartment was warm to come in to from the cold. A great place to stay."

I enthusiastically recommend his place on Horatio, and I look forward to re-booking it again very soon."
2268,7241,3288945,1/6/13,4164708,Mikhail,"It is our first experience with airbnb. And we are very glad that it began so well! We were met by Kenneth, it was very kind and waited for us despite that that we couldn't call in advance to it because of problems with communication. The apartment very much was pleasant to us, in it you feel comfortably, not as in the apartment which often lease. As it has a convenient arrangement, near the subway and shops. Golden mean between the Areas of Soho, Italian, Chinese and a time the square. Let's be always glad to return to John."
2269,7241,3353020,1/15/13,4462852,Joseph,"Had the most wonderful time staying at John's apartment. The location is PERFECT to see the city.

The building is great, secure and well kept. John was excellent to deal with; replying swiftly and extremely helpful with my stay - I can't recommend staying here more!"

The apartment itself is small but comes well equipped (the kitchen is well appointed and has everything you need to either prepare full meals or just store and reheat leftovers) is exceptionally cozy and has a ton of character. In spite of being just a stone's throw away from the meatpacking district, 14th St, and 8th Ave, the apartment is quiet and peaceful - a great place to listen to sounds of the city without being overwhelmed by them. John was a very accommodating and helpful host. He was quick to answer questions, flexible with check-in and out, and provided helpful advice about the neighborhood.

The location is perfect, central and a few blocks from 3 different lines of subway.  We could hardly get a better location.  The room was perfect and very clean.  The air-conditionned was very appreciated.  The breakfast was excellent and very diversified: coffee or tea, bagels, cream cheese (3 different flavors), cereals (granola), yogourt and fresh fruits.  On our first day, one of us asked for orange juice and toasts.  As this was missing, Doti proposed to go right away to buy some for us.  Guess what... on the second morning, there was orange juice and toasts for us...  she even proposed us to cook eggs as she thought we had not eaten enough.  Doti is always doing her best to accomodate people and help us planned our day.  A few times, she searched the internet to help us better plan our day and to provide information on shows going on.  This is extremely appreciated.  Thank you so much Doti and be sure that if we go back to NYC we will book your place again.   Louis et Michel."

It is only a hop and a jump to anything in Manhatten. We were VERY thankful for the air condition unit, since it was quite hot during our stay. Being out and about during the (hot) days, we greatly appreciated a refreshing shower, the comfortable bed, and the coolness of the room at night.

I truly felt at home and the apartment and its location were incredible. Travelling to New York alone for a week I was somewhat apprehensive but Doti and Kerry made me so welcome and such a part of their family that my trip was wonderful. Doti and Kerry are incredibly knowledgeable about New York and where to go and what to see (Gotham Comedy Club is a must!)and the apartment is two streets (2 mins) away from 2 seperate subway lines making it easy to get anywhere in Manhatten, as well as close to amazing delis, cafes, restaurants etc. Chelsea Perfect is well....PERFECT and I cannot wait to go back!

She wasn't phased, got me settled and comfortable and made the experience exactly what I needed.  I came from a hotel and this experience blew it away.  I slept great, had everything I needed and was offered help with some details that would have just been a hassle if I was at a hotel.  Strongly recommend.  "

2323,7322,17601,11/17/09,45709,Brian,"We had a lovely stay with Doti, and she was great with helping us with directions and places in the neighborhood to eat. Her breakfast was a real treat, and started off our days with warmth and cheer. Brian and Barbara"
2324,7322,18278,11/25/09,37891,Paul,"I strongly recommend Chelsea Perfect!  Doti is a great host...she offers gracious hospitality while respecting privacy.  Her apartment is a warm, charming and welcome ""home"" in a prime location; the guest bed is superbly comfortable.  I especially appreciated the continual flow of coffee, the great advice on where to shop close by and the feeling that her goal was to make sure I was taken care of.  Chelsea Perfect is aptly named and I would recommend it to anyone.  -Paul "
2325,7322,18636,11/29/09,47439,Jen,We stayed with Doti for the thanksgiving holiday and can honestly say that the room was great and comfortable and Doti was very very welcoming and helpful in every way! We will be coming back to stay at Chelsea Perfect next time we visit New York again. Also we loved the location we were in walking distance to most places if not the subway was close by. Thank you Doti!
2326,7322,20434,12/15/09,52213,Kathy,My daughter and I stayed with Doti and Kerry for four nights in mid December. They are lovely hosts whose comfortable apartment is within walking distance of all areas of lower Manhatten and midtown. Breakfast was delicious and the conversation great. Doti truly enjoys hosting guests in her apartment and in her city. I hope to be able to stay with her again.
2327,7322,22372,1/2/10,30955,Pauline,"5 out of 5We so enjoyed staying at Chelsea Perfect. Full marks go to Doti for being the perfect hostess. She is kind, sensitive, thoughtful and incredibly helpful. Our stay lasted 9 days; there was never a minute when we wished we were staying any-where else. The convenient location of Chelsea Perfect combined with the care we received from Doti, made for a wonderful vacation in New York. We both highly recommend Chelsea Perfect for your accommodation in New York.   Peter and Pauline"
2328,7322,24455,1/19/10,67180,Nicholas,"Chelsea Perfect lives up to its name...great location and Doti is an impeccable host.  My fiancee and I stayed four nights, but even after the first night we felt like we were staying with friends.  Doti and her husband Kerry are warm, friendly and laid-back, and did everything they could to make sure our time in NYC was a good one.  We were so glad we chose Chelsea Perfect over some cheap hotel room.  Even The Plaza hotel can't offer the real, human experience that you will get at Chelsea Perfect."
2329,7322,24901,1/26/10,69893,Pam,"Believe the reviews! Doti,Kerry and the Chelsea Perfect were a wonderfully memorable experience. My daughter and I came away feeling like we had visited family. Our hosts were very attentive to our every need,whether we wanted to interact or have our privacy.Staying in an arty neighborhood with people who are representative of that community was a worthwhile experience"
2330,7322,25698,2/8/10,61009,Sinead,"Doti and Kerry were wonderful. This was our first trip to NYC and they made us feel comfortable and nothing was too much. We were able to ask for advice regarding the city and they were both so helpful. Their apartment is in an ideal location for all sights and shops in NYC and Times Sq is a stones throw away but without the noise on an evening. It is 5 minute walk from the subway and fantastic diners/restaurants/bars and coffee shops recommended to us by Doti. Breakfast every morning was delightful and the coffee, fresh bagels and conversation was the perfect way to start the day in a perfect city. The bedroom was spacious and the bed lovely and comfortable! Staying with Doti and Kerry gives you a true New York feel and they are fantastic people. Doti is the perfect host and I would recommend Chelsea perfect to anyone! We can't wait to return asap!"
2331,7322,26194,2/15/10,32775,Jean-Marie,"The place is well situated in the center of Manhattan, that means you get to almost anywhere walking. 20 minutes from Times square and the same at night to get back from the best jazz clubs our main interest. The appartment is not huge, the bathroom is shared, but Doti's comprehensive, smart and a sensible person. We felt some emotion leaving the place. Bill Evans played : ""We will meet again"" and we hope so (and Doti, as promised if you come to South of France I will lend you my scooter :-) "
2332,7322,26786,2/18/10,79738,Pia,"We have had a great time at Doti's place. Her appartment is very nice and comfortable, locatedin the centre of Manhattan. Apart from the famous sites one can visit in New York, and all the different touristic activities one can do, Doti's delicious breakfast (lots of fresh fruits, bagels, joghurt and cereals, coffe and tea..) definitely belongs to the things one just has to experience :-).We won't forget Doti's hospitality, and if we came back to NYC one day, her place would be our first choice."
2333,7322,26940,2/20/10,70404,Annamarie,"Staying at Chelsea Perfect was a treat. The home is unique and immaculately kept. Breakfast was great, the bed was great, and the water pressure in the shower was great. Conversation with Doti and Kerry was a highlight. I would not hesitate to recommend this listing. My family and I feel as though we walked away with the perfect New York experience and new friends."
2334,7322,27598,2/26/10,59558,Brenda,"We had an excellent time at Doti and Kerry's apartment in Chelsea. She is a great host, made us feel welcome.  Also was very helpful in planning our day...she really went the extra mile. Thank-you so much, we had a wonderful vacation!!"
2335,7322,28410,3/6/10,74935,Didit,I enjoyed my stay at Doti's place. We had interesting conversations while I enjoyed the delicious breakfast she prepared for me. And the location is fantastic!
2336,7322,29770,3/16/10,77295,Andrea,"This was our first time staying in a residential B&B. Doti was a great host and laid-out a great breakfast each morning (with many great choices). She is a great conversationalist and knows the area well. She also participated in my fiance's marriage proposal scheme!The apartment is in a safe and VERY convenient area of the city. We had a really easy time getting to all of the places we wanted to see without taking any cabs (we walked or took the sub, which was 2 blocks away). The apartment is a one-bedroom/one-bath (the living room doubles as their bedroom at night) and felt a little tighter than what we expected from the pictures, but there was enough space to move around and it's probably typical for New York. If you're used to sleeping in quiet, bring some (Website hidden by Airbnb) usually wasn't a problem, but there was one night/morning when street noise got pretty loud (that's NYC).I would consider staying here again on our next trip and would recommend her to our friends!"
2337,7322,31116,3/24/10,51709,Graham,This was our first visit to both the USA and New York. Doti greeted us on arrival as though we were old friends and made us feel realy at home. We were very comfortable in the apartment and Dotiâ€™s breakfasts set us up for our days walking round the city. The location is ideally placed for travelling up or down town â€“ and we can definitely recommend it!
2338,7322,32106,3/29/10,86212,Mia,"We just returned from a four-day stay with Doti and have nothing but positive things to say about our experience.  Doti's apartment gave us a real taste of life in New York City.  Her neighborhood is artsy and fun, her place is unique and homey, and she is lovely and welcoming.  We slept like babies every night in the lovely bedroom (something we didn't expect in such a busy city).  The neighborhood was quiet at night and we felt safe walking the Chelsea streets whatever the time of day or evening.  The breakfast has been mentioned, but I will say again that it was a highlight of our visit.  On our last day she made fresh cream and got us scones, as well as the yogurt, bagels and fruit she provided every morning.  We would stay here again for sure."
2339,7322,32538,3/31/10,95295,Elizabeth,"We couldn't have asked for a nicer situation:  clean room, very comfortable bed, wonderful breakfast, excellent location. Although we shared a small apartment with our hosts,Doti and Kerry, we felt as though we were visiting old friends. It would be difficult not to feel comfortable with them.  We relied on Doti for a number of suggestions, from restaurants to shopping, and her advice was perfect.  We'll be back."
2340,7322,32634,4/1/10,82486,Sharon,"despite we have been in NY only one night, we loved staying in Doti's place. The room was very comfortable and Doti and Kerry have been so friendly and hospitable, so that we felt like at home. We really enjoyed our stay."
2341,7322,34316,4/9/10,68129,Ulf,"What a perfect way to get to know New York â€“ and a New Yorker family. We spend more than a week in Chelsea, at Doti and Kerrys place. Close to almost everything in Manhattan which was the first and main reason for our choice of staying. Well, the other reason was â€œthe prize was rightâ€ù, compared to hotel. But as both reasons were fulfilled, there was another reason that made our stay super, the host family. They gave us the best of breakfasts, gave us a lot of useful information about the town, searched the net for more information and made phonecall for tickets, and we shared some time with interesting talks about different things. We stayed three in the bedroom but never felt it was to small. Bathroom and shower, shared with the host family, worked out nice. This was a great way of staying in New York.Karl, Gun and Filip, Sweden"
2342,7322,34692,4/10/10,103689,Sandonei,Great place and pleasant host. Thanks Doti
2343,7322,34740,4/11/10,73906,Christina,We had a lovely stay at Chelsea Perfect. The assistance with the city was great adn the bed was cozy! Quiet but convenient! 
2344,7322,35764,4/15/10,103297,Kim,"Chelsea Perfect exceeded our expectations by a country mile. What a find! Doti runs a comfortable, clean, and well organized place in a great location, and she is a generous host. We wished we could have spent more time there on this trip, and we know where we'll aim for the next time. There's no need for hotels when something this good is available."
2345,7322,35892,4/16/10,90833,Susan,"After a long day of travel and emerging from Penn Station to the thrilling density of Manhattan, it was wonderful to be welcomed into Doti's home. She was extremely gracious and attentive. I actually enjoyed a dinner with her and her friend Johanna at a little Indian Restaurant around the corner. To arrive in a new city, and within a couple hours, be sitting down, enjoying a meal, and sharing ""what I love about living in New York"" stories with two locals is a rare treat. Her place was clean and comfortable (including the bed!) She and her husband Kerry were super sensitive to my needs, both for privacy and for assistance. A wonderful beginning to my stay in New York!"
2346,7322,36198,4/18/10,63870,Janice,"I just returned from New York after a weekend spent at Chelsea Perfect. Even before I arrived, I thought of Doti as a friend, due to her warm, concerned emails. I felt at home immediately. She provides everything a traveler could possibly need, including robes like those in fine hotels, use of a hairdryer, and current magazines about happenings in New York. She goes out of her way to prepare what you want for breakfast. I mentioned that I liked pineapple the first morning, and the next morning it magically appeared. Dot and her husband are very interesting people, and if you like books, as I do, you will be in heaven. They have the largest selection I have seen outside of a bookstore. I'm already looking forward to staying with them on my next trip to New York."
2347,7322,37726,4/25/10,71758,Cathy,"From Doti's first warm greeting, I was completely at ease and felt like I was staying with friends. The bed was fantastic, so cozy and comfortable. The shower was great, and everything was provided (including the hair dryer!) The apartment is very well situated for going uptown or downtown, within 5 min of subway, 2 min of hailing a cab, 20 min walk to Times Square, and in a great neighborhood filled with food, arts, and great people watching.  AND, Macy's flagship 11 story store is 10 minutes walk!! The breakfasts were wonderful and made ""to order"", and Doti and Kerry are the most gracious hosts, there when you want to chat and invisible when you want privacy!!  Will definitely go back to visit. Thanks Doti."

We fell in love with Chelsea and are considering moving halfway across country to live there. Doti let us check in early,store our bags in the apartment, and offered us tea and coffee while the room was still in use by the previous guests. She was extremely helpful with recommendations, transportation tips, and was very detailed oriented. If you're looking for a safe, great location, and warm place to stay, this is the place. Oh, and did I mention affordable? Doti loves to travel- and so do we, so for any savvy traveler, this is the place to be. "

They cover a wide variety of subjects, if one has the time and inclination.   Doti enjoys being a hostess and has an interest in her guests.

Doti made us very welcome and is very knowledgeable about all aspects of the city, including things to do and recommending very good restaurants, even addresses for knitting shops.

Two different subway stations running five different lines are just a 5 minute walk from her place, giving one easy access to both uptown and downtown. There are also plently of things to do+see+eat around her neighbourhood... Chelsea market (for really good coffee @ 9th St Espresso, sandwiches @ Hale and Hearty, cakes, cookies.. and a couple of seafood markets), Billy's cupcakes, Whole Foods market (which is just round the corner from her place and is an excellent spot to buy groceries. I love the salad bars here!), and not too far off is Madison Sq Park (Shake Shack burger!! A must GO!). I was also able to walk further down to 5th Ave and Union Sq where there's a lot of shopping to be done. Most of the mid-brands that you find in mid-town can be found here as well.Doti is a very warm and friendly person, who offered me a lot of suggestions on what to do, where to go and how to get there. She never hesitates to log on her computer to help me check out information of places, and even found out what is the luggage weight limit for my airline. Since I was traveling alone, it was a huge plus to come back in the evening to a friendly face and shared how my day went. Doti's place is clean and tidy, even though she has a big collection of books. The room I stayed in is big, the bed is comfortable, towels are provided and there's also a dresser to store my clothes. I would definitely stay with her again!"

Doti herself was away but her husband, Kerry, was a brilliant stand-in host and went beyond the call of duty to ensure I had a really comfortable, relaxed and easy time staying in their extremely welcoming home. The best part of each day was the time Kerry took to chat and answer my questions over copious quantities of toast and scrambled eggs, and excellent coffee from the brilliant old-style coffee percolator.  I really valued the privacy of the room I stayed in, and the fact it looked out over a really beautiful tree which was in full flower, and the tranquility of the street below - yes, it really WAS New York! - meant that I slept like a log, totally undisturbed.  What heaven!  The sense of security and comfort, combined with the convenience of having keys so you can pop back to the flat whenever you need, but most importantly being just a minute away from a really useful subway station, loads of busses, and even an easy walk to key attractions in the middle of Manhattan, meant that I felt incredibly lucky to be staying at Chelsea Perfect.  I can thoroughly recommend staying there!  It made my holiday and it'll make yours."

This was by far a superior experience than staying in a hotel.  The location of Doti's apartment can't be beat; right in the heart of Chelsea, close to the subways, the Village, and the Piers.  Doti provided us with a very comfortable bedroom and plenty of privacy; breakfast and coffee in the morning was a plus!  Doti and her husband were great to visit with and provided helpful hints on navigating the city.  The overall experience was a ""5"" and we wouldn't hesitate to stay with her again!

Breakfast provided a great start to the day and we would often chat with Doti and Kerry, forgetting the time.  They are a font of knowledge and our chats covered many subjects including where to go for a great meal.All in all a wonderful stay and if we go back there is only one place for us to stay..........Dot (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) s"

She researched and suggested activities for us, helped us figure out how to get around and indulged us in our favourite things for breakfast. All this in spite of having some difficult family issues to deal with at the time. Doti and Kerry's small and pleasantly cluttered apartment is in a convenient location for exploring Manhattan. The bedroom, well endowed with furniture and possessions, was comfortable, especially the bed, and very private. Doti is a warm and generous person, and I enjoyed her company and having a chat and a laugh with her. Thanks Doti, I hope to see you again sometime."

Hospitality could not be better: warm NY bagels and cream cheese was perfect for breakfast plus there was lots of fresh fruit, cereals and more...... all kind of useful tips to go around and survive in the city that never sleeps, perfectly clean, and more importantly the sympathy of a smily good morning from our hosts made us feel home.For that reason we say:  NYC is ""aka"" Dotiâ€˜s place!!! We loved it!!!! and always remember: Lets go Mets!!! :)))))"

She would make anything you want for breakfast. The bedroom and bathroom were spacious and the bed was super comfortable. We enjoyed our chats with Doti during breakfast and at times in the evening. Doti was very helpful with tips on sightseeing and how to get around Manhattan. Her apartment is in a great location as there are many restaurants and shops.

Not too far from Times Square and other touristy parts of the city. I stayed with two other girls, it was a little cramped for 3 because the air bed took up a bit of room but we managed.

Its location is truly convenient to everywhere.  The metro is steps away.  The surrounding neighborhood has much to offer.

Doti placed chocolates in our room!   When our friend arrived in NY,  Doti  was able to accommodate her  in the bedroom on an  air mattress for two nights.

But she is extramely allergic to (Website hidden by Airbnb) if you wanna cook or eat any scallops. That's impossible. Anyway. My boyfriend and I had a great time with Doti. Her breakfast was amazing. Generally, It's a good place and location to stay and very convenience to take a subway or ride a bus. Especially it's very easy to take an taxi around her place. You know It's very hard sometimes to get a taxi in Mahattan in rush hours:) For a Mahattan room rental. It's a wonderful place to stay!"

When we came home from sightseeing, we have warm and nicely folded laundry on the bed. It was not something we expect of her, but she did it graciously. We have good conversations in the mornings and we appreciate the little things she did for us, like leaving chocolates out for us in our room. The house is absolutely clean, the room is comfortable for 3 people, and we loved the large screen TV with cable in the room to come back to after a long day. On our last day, she waited with us for the taxi and gave us all a good bye hug.

2416,7322,2838353,11/8/12,3624797,Antoinette,"SHOCKING describes best the place, beginning with the odor the moment you walk in, the narrow hallway, where you have to walk sideways, the clutter, and more clutter in every room, etc. But that's not enough, this is a one bedroom and one bathroom apt. and the hosts sleep in the living room with curtains, which they close at night. The bathroom is shared, I never expected this. The picture is true to the place when cleaned up. However, t doesn't show the clutter on the wall opposite the bed, and it wasn't cleared of the clutter everywhere. DO NOT BELIEVE THE PICTURE. I HAVE THE REAL ONES AND THEY ARE SHOCKING. A bare third world place is more comfortable than this. I came home one afternoon to shower before the evening and found that clothes were drying over the bath tub, so no shower. I hate to give such a review because the hosts were accommodating, but I feel it my obligation to be honest. We had no room for suitcases, everything went on the floor, a few clothes were hung on a hook over the door. I never expected the hosts' would use the guests' room to store their own stuff upon stuff in every corner and on much of the floor of their apt. The building itself needed better housekeeping and upgrading, the location was convenient. So sorry that I can't recommend this place under any circumstances. If you doubt me, I took pictures because words can't describe the condition of this place. "

I had a sudden cancelation with my hotel accommodations. Although my stay was short she made it more than memorable. Her place was just as advertised; and extremely warm, cozy, comfortable and friendly. The room and apartment were very clean and well maintained, with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. The apartment is cozy and eclectic. There was unlimited hot water and the long hot shower was quite fantastic at the end of a long and harrowing travel experience. The location is great. Access to the trains, museums, shops and restaurants were all within a few blocks - easy reach. As well as Time Square and Broadway being about a three minute subway ride away â€“ and where my meetings were. I had no problem in finding my way with her maps and directions.She and her husband were very kind and attentive. I arrived at the apartment late with a weeksâ€™ worth of dirty laundry and they insisted on taking care of it for me so that I could relax and still have fresh clothes for the next morning and before leaving on the next leg of my trip. Their attention to the detail of my needs made my trip much less stressful and ultimately more successful. I canâ€™t imagine how I would have been able to handle the meetings I had to engage in the next day if they hadnâ€™t taken me in and taken the time and interest to take care of me as they did. Sandy had left me on the road for nearly two weeks, my schedule a wreck and me emotionally bent! Chelsea Perfect was a soothing respite. I canâ€™t say enough about a stranger who would take me in and do so much. I was sorry not to be able to stay longer to enjoy it, rest and recover and to assist in the recovering city. Chelsea and Chelsea Perfect are my headings when I am back in NYC!

2419,7322,2883293,11/13/12,396829,Daniela,"Whenever I come to New York City I stay with Dot. So I have been using her Bed & Breakfast already 7 or 8 times in the past couple of years and it is always exciting, and feels so much like â€œcomforting cozy homeâ€ù that I do not want to leave. In fact it has been my home for 2 months when I did an internship at the United Nations in 2010 and I can say that staying with a host for that long is really the acid test for an accommodation and a friendship. What can I say? I always return with excited anticipation.There are so many things I love about Dot and her apartment that I am afraid the space provided here will not suffice to share all of them. First, Dot is a wonderful, warm, comforting person. She goes above and beyond to make her guests feel welcome and is extremely considerate, respectful, and accommodating. You can ask her for everything and she will try to get it, find out about it, and organize it for you instantly. Dot is also really flexible. There were times when I poured my heart out to her, and there were times when I wanted to be left alone, there were times when I asked her for professional advice, and there where times when we laughed together and had fun. â€œEverything goesâ€ù with Dot. For NYC the apartment is pretty spacious, and Dot is respectful of personal space So much so that most of the times it feels like you have the apartment to yourself, even though she is there, working quietly from her couch, yet always approachable for questions and concerns. The apartment is truly beautiful and comforting. Dot has worked creatively in many areas and you can experience her sense for art, interior, antiques and decoration in every season. Since I have been there many times I am always looking forward to novel ideas decorative arrangements she composes. Among colorful accents, yesterday it was an arrangement of fresh flowers and herbs that gave a natural, fresh, and festive scent to the place â€“ I loved it!Speaking of natural â€“ Dot will always provide you with organic foods. She takes great interest in green living (which as European I appreciate) and sustainable, clean food. She goes to any lengths to provide you with organic fresh fruit, fresh bagels, and loads of other organic delights to your liking (she really gets up at 5AM to get these things fresh daily!) that come beautifully arranged and decorated on your breakfast table. Also, her coffee and teas are organic, yummy!  Truly, I am picky about my living space because it is an important â€œhome baseâ€ù wherever I am and I need personal space and sometimes a guide or friend. If you are looking for comfort, peace, nourishment, and easy-going communication, book with Dot. I guarantee you a great experience and a â€œspaâ€ù for your body, mind, and soul. I LOVE DOTI. "

When I stayed with Dot at her ultra-cozy Chelsea space, I was going into my third week of being displaced from the storm. After spending many a night on friends' couches (eight in total), I was looking for a warm bed with a little personal space where I could recoup. I couldn't have been more happy with what I found. Firstly, the bed is amazing. I haven't fell that fast asleep in a long time. In the room, there is a gas fireplace and cable TV -- a real treat! Dot also has chocolates on the side-table and lush bathrobes on the door, plus all the bathroom necessities. What's more, Dot & her husband Kerry are a sweet, sweet couple. I very much enjoyed chatting with them about books (their walls are lined with them for you to read!) over a delicious organic breakfast the next morning. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! "

Close to so many things and near my meeting.I love the atmosphere at Doti's.  It is like a charming friendly Inn and yet you are in the city.  Doti and Kerry were great hosts.  They were respectful of my work needs and helpful with information about the area and local activities.  I felt so comfortable visiting with them.  I feel like I have two new friends.I am very picky about cleanliness, especially in the bathroom.  The room and bathroom were immaculate.  The bed was cozy and the bedroom has a little electric fireplace to give it a comfy feeling.  I wish I could have stayed in bed and read a book but I had to get to business.  Maybe next time.Now, the best part.  You will not get a fresh, organic and healthy breakfast like this anywhere I know of.  It was delightful to enjoy fresh berries and scones and chat with Doti.  And the coffee is great!I gave this listing the highest rating because of the location, the hosts, the lovely clean accommodations, the atmosphere and the delicious breakfast.

Doti and her husband were very kind and prepared us delicious healthy breakfasts every morning (fruit, yogurt, muesli -- just as we had requested!  She had emailed to ask us before what we would like.)  The place was incredibly clean and Doti was very attentive.  We would definitely stay here again -- highly recommended!"
2424,7322,2974311,11/26/12,4177014,Laurel,"Doti was super accommodating and something even more difficult to come by these days â€“ genuinely caring about our comfort and well being.  When we showed up late to our stated arrival time, she expressed concern for our getting a little lost on the way there! (This was a result of sleep deprivation - as her home is central and easy to find.)  I am an artist and I love eclectic things, reading, and Doti's home told many stories through the abundance of books, art, and other items around the apartment. If you prefer minimalism, this may not be the place for you. If you like an experience, would enjoy meeting caring New Yorkers (Doti and her husband were both kind and welcoming), and enjoy staying in a room that feels as though it was made up just for your comfort, then this is the place for you.  Doti and her daughter (who was visiting) also helped us to plan a few of our stops, and to get student tickets to the New York Philharmonic ($15 each instead of $150)!  Our short stay (2 days only!)  in New York would not have been nearly so marvelous had we not stayed with Doti at Chelsea Perfect.  I hope to return again, as I feel I have a new friend in New York!  I'm also inspired to redesign my own room to capture some of the cozy comfort that Doti's guest room had.  Extra bonus: Doti was always ready with a hot cup of coffee, she provided a lovely New York bagel breakfast and most importantly, a safe, super comforting environment to come home to on a fast paced trip to the city that never sleeps (but always sleeps in).

2429,7322,3067657,12/11/12,4243794,Adam,"We stayed at Doti's for just one night and it was perfect. While Doti had a personal emergency and had to quickly skip town, her husband was present and was an excellent host. The room and the apartment are as comfortable as the her photos appear. The hosts maintain the ""B&B"" mentality, operating more of a bed and breakfast. Note for breakfast aficionados - the breakfast provided is of excellent quality. The apartment is within a few blocks of two metro stops and is in the heart of Chelsea. Staying here was a pleasure and we hope to visit again soon."

This was our first time using airbnb and will definitely not be our last.My girlfriend and I were in NYC for a December weekend and Chelsea Perfect was a fantastic base for our trip. Doti and Kerry are wonderful hosts. Doti was fantastic during the booking process, responding quickly to queries and providing lots of helpful information.Although we did not get to meet Doti, her husband Kerry made sure we felt very welcome in their home and was extremely helpful and friendly, while at the same time giving us the space we needed to come and go as we please, etc.Doti and Kerry have been doing this for a while, and it clearly shows with their incredible attention to detail and willingness to help with all aspects of our trip. It seemed like they had thought of everything. Kerry went to fetch us fresh bagels for breakfast, delicious!The room is cozy, spacious, and the bed very comfortable, definitely as advertised.Location is brilliant, within walking distance of SO much, and subway stations are mere minutes away, ready to whisk you to NYC destinations further afield.Cannot recommend enough. We look forward to staying again during our next visit to Chelsea!"
2432,7322,3126950,12/20/12,358010,Brian,"Was on my feet all day prior to fetching up at Doti's at 11:00 PM.  Easy to find the building, easy to get up to 4th floor apt.  Said hello, said goodnight, went to bed, fell asleep in maybe 20 seconds.  Woke at 6 the next day, enjoyed a truly outstanding cup of fresh-ground coffee with Kerry (Doti was away), and was out the door for the train.  Takeaways are:1) Really comfortable bed.2) Significant # of books to peruse on next visit3) TV remotes work  - uncommon4) Did I mention the coffee was exceptional"

Her apartment is warm, well-organised and nothing is too much trouble. Doti welcomed us with a lovely cuppa and a good chat (it was New Year's day and bitterly cold outside). She is a very warm and giving host who clearly enjoys meeting new guests from around the world. The bed was SUPER comfy too and the breakfast was out of this world. I'd definitely recommend her as a host. She's very experienced and knows what guests are looking for in a comfortable stay."
2434,7322,3351500,1/15/13,1827537,Kathrin,"Even though I stayed only two nights at Doti's place, it felt like entering another world. Chelsea Perfect is indeed the perfect name for her lovely place. I was overwhelmed when entering my room and if I didn't have to explore New York, I would have loved to just stay in that cosy bed by the beautiful fireplace. The location is also simply perfect - very close to the subway station, walking distance to Chelsea market or the Flatiron building, lots of great restaurants around.Above all, Doti was a great and very welcoming and caring host. You can either decide to have your privacy in your cosy room or have very interesting conversations with Doti. Two perfect days at Chelsea Perfect! "

And that goes for the 15 years old as well. Different tea every morning - fresh fruit - bagels - etc.. it was great to be able to experience NYC every morning after breakfast.She helped with reservations, she knew which places where close because of Sandy, before we came we mailed to have her help us with different things.She was so interested and asked questions so that she was able to come up with ideas for us to try when we were there.If she wasn't able to cook for us, Gary did or he pick up the best homebaked bread :-)Hopefully we will be able to come back and stay, we werenÂ´t finish with NYC when we left and we have tons to talk about with Doti and Gary.Thank you for making our NYC trip so memorable.Chelsea Perfect is the best place we could have been, so glad we found it."

The room was very comfortable and quietly secluded from the rest of the apartment. Also, given that the location is right in the heart of Chelsea, I was pleasantly surprised with the relaxed neighborhood feel and quiet. Everything is literally at your doorstep, or at most a very short walk away (restaurants, services, access to any of a number of subway lines, the High Line and - of course - galleries). Breakfasts - complete with Murray's bagels - were a great way to start the day. My only reservation in recommending so highly, is that it will probably make it more difficult for me to book to stay again in the future ;-)"

They are always ready with useful info and advice about how to access the neighbourhood and the city's amazing resources.

Vi fick dessutom mycket goda frukostar, tips pÃ¥ restauranger, sevÃ_rdheter och kommunikationer och inte minst, mÃ¶jlighet att umgÃ¥s och finna en ny vÃ_n.  "
2492,7322,165028584,6/30/17,120940401,Frithjof,"Alles, was bisher Ã_ber Doti geschrieben wurde, war glatt untertrieben! Sie ist so wunderbar, dass man eigentlich etwas negatives schreiben mÃ_sste,  um das nÃ_chste Mal in New York wieder die Chance zu haben, bei ihr wohnen zu dÃ_rfen.Ohne Zweifel ein tolle Gastgeberin.Einmal bei ihr, braucht man nie wieder etwas anderes zu suchen, wenn man nach New York reisen mÃ¶chte."
2493,7322,248038876,3/30/18,148144865,Josh,"Very thankful for accommodating us with last minute travel change of plans.  Host was very gracious in providing breakfast,  coffee, and snacks and warm hospitality. Excellent location close to subway lines. Thank you!"

Disfrutamos mucho compartir charlas y conocer mucho sobre la historia y la cultura del paÃ_s.El departamento tiene una ubicaciÃ_n privilegiada, muy accesible y cerca de muchas atracciones, medios de transporte y negocios varios.La comodidad es superior. La habitaciÃ_n estÃ¡ alejada de las Ã¡reas comunes, lo cual permite tener privacidad si se desea. La cama es comodÃ_sima, ideal para cuando llegas de caminar durante todo el dÃ_a.Todo estÃ¡ muy limpio. La ducha es ideal para sobrevivir al frÃ_o de la ciudad y la cocina tiene todo lo necesario para preparar lo que se desee.El desayuno merece un apartado especial. Cada maÃ±ana tenÃ_amos el desayuno preparado de acuerdo a nuestros gustos (cafÃ©, frutas, tostadas, bagels, huevos, cereales), ideal para iniciar el dÃ_a con mucha energÃ_a.En resumen, recomendamos 100% alojarse allÃ_, por la calidad del lugar y la calidez y amabilidad de los anfitriones."
2495,7322,254879927,4/18/18,44428900,David,"Doti's place is a great value, for Manhattan. The location works well for me. My host was very friendlyand informative. I would certainly stay here again."
2496,7322,257838770,4/27/18,22943422,James,"We were in New York for the Tribeca film Festival, in Chelsea and TriBeCa, and this was a great location for us! A very good value. Doti was out of town, but her husband, Kerry, was very flexible and helpful, and made us very nice breakfasts to order each day."
2497,7322,261996461,5/7/18,161579435,Melissa,"We had a wonderful weekend staying here in Chelsea.  Kerry was helping us while Doti was out of town, but Doti still emailed and checked up on us. They were both so helpful in what to do while in the area.  I would stay here anytime I was in the area again."
2498,7322,264273660,5/13/18,31457954,Madilyn,"The hosts take great pride in their home and rightly so... you will feel very welcomed in and part of the family. The communication prior to arrival and throughout the stay was excellent and they were very hospitable, offering anything we needed and more."
2499,7322,265298676,5/16/18,11890637,Rosemary,"If you have ever travelled in Europe, and stayed in a city flat, then this very similar. Look carefully at the pictures, because the hostess uses her space wisely and efficiently as all walls are utilized. The bedroom is huge. In fact, it is bigger than my hotel room at HGU.  The power strips on each side of the bed are accessible for all your electrical needs. Antique furniture is adorable and the mirrors on each side of bed are handy as the bathroom does not have a power outlet. The dining area is quaint, the kitchen compact. Coffee very good. Host and hostess are friendly and want to meet your breakfast preferences, but. Their specialty is local bagels with cream cheese and also bagel egg sandwiches. They have tips galore!  I needed a cobbler to fix my shoe, and was recommended  a close and reasonable one. Directions? I was pointed quickly in the right direction. By the way, the locations is ideal close to public transit and minutes away from everything. This apartment is shared with the hostess."
2500,7322,265843536,5/18/18,54382166,Julian Antonio,"Great place to stay thatâ€™s overshadowed by the even better host. Doti was so warm and accommodating, and it really stood out among all the airbnbs that Iâ€™ve stayed in. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in New York."
2501,7322,267411806,5/21/18,36817673,Donna,First time we have shared a home and it couldnâ€™t have been better. Most gracious hosts who were more like family!  Her breakfasts were wonderful and the bed was very comfy! Also very helpful with directions etc

Perfect location, close to everything... or close to a train that will take you to everything . Literally had everything you could ask for in an AB&B experience.  Highest recommendation!!  Don't stay in a hotel when you can stay here. "

A lovely private room with antique furnishings, comfortable bed, delicious breakfast ( fresh fruit,  eggs, bagels and more) and best of all, our hosts Doti and Kerry- kind, generous, brilliant, so helpful, fascinating folks!  We feel like they are our new family in New York. Great location - plenty  of cool shops nearby,  great restaurants,  close to transportation, and the Highline.  An ideal experience in every way!"

Breakfast was prepared each morning which is rare and Dotiâ€™s husband, Kerry, did a great job of giving us some local tips to enjoy the city. Would definitely stay here again!"
2507,7322,276345659,6/13/18,21365664,Chris,"Chelsea perfect is a good name for this listing. Great location easily accessible by subway and located in the heart of a great neighborhood. The hosts are warm, generous, and have a great history of defining hospitality and the Airbnb model. The bedroom is a classic, very comfortable, and that room and the bathroom are immaculately clean and well appointed. Looking forward to going back soon!"
2508,7322,277490684,6/16/18,11486903,Edwin,"People like Doti & Kerry are the reason I love to travel with AirBnB: theyâ€™re caring, interested and enabling you to live as a local for a few days.Our stay in NYC was brilliant and Kerry prepared us an excellent breakfast every day.

2512,7322,291249583,7/15/18,6908381,Eun-Ah,"I made a reservation for my friends and they really loved this place. They said both Doti and the place were so lovely. Additionally, I was so much impressed by her efforts to communicate with her guests. She not only fully informed the important things in regards to staying at her place but also cared about what the guests wanted and was willing to be flexible to accommodate the guestsâ€™ need or request. I hope to have a chance to stay at her house myself in the future."
2513,7322,292273142,7/17/18,10058321,Molly,"The room was very comfortable and provided everything I needed. Doti is very attentive and generous with her time, breakfasts, snacks and offers to assist. Having been a frequent user of Airbnb, this was my first time in NYC. I think this gave me a better understanding of typical lifestyle for many people living in NY flats. Doti has purposed every bit of the space. She has a collection of antiques and books that she lovingly displays in this Chelsea apartment. Communication was easy. I enjoyed walking to the Highline one morning and this neighborhood is convenient to many attractions. "

My wife and I stayed in her guest bedroom, which looked exactly like the pictures. The bed was comfy, the room was clean, and Dotiâ€™s breakfast was wonderful. I had just arrived after being out of town for a conference and Doti was able to do my laundry for me. Her apartment is 2 blocks from the subway and perfect for getting anywhere around town. There are plenty of restaurants near by and great nightlife in the Chelsea area. We highly recommend staying with Doti and will definitely stay here next time weâ€™re in NYC. Thanks Doti for being a superb host!"
2516,7322,294790091,7/22/18,22002442,Meghan,"Doti was a great host!! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a welcoming place to stay in a great, central location. "

She even ordered delicious NY bagels for us one morning for breakfast. We loved getting to meet Doti and will 100% look to stay in her home again on our next visit to NYC.The apartment is wonderfully located in Chelsea. Everything we wanted to visit was easily reachable by walking or the metro. The sleeping and living space was very comfortable. The bed was very nice. Towels and soaps were provided for us. Every want and need we had was filled. I would highly recommend Doti's home to future visitors."
2521,7322,300233805,8/1/18,2704910,Greg,"We were only there one night, arriving a bit late, but we were warmly welcomed and made to feel comfortable and at home in a very genuine way. Our large bedroom, and the bathroom (and the whole apartment), were very clean and well organized, with many interesting books everywhere we looked. A variety of fresh and tasty breakfast choices were offered (Doti is one of the rare hosts that really understands the second ""b"" of Airbnb), and our check-out day needs were graciously accommodated. The location is excellent, very convenient to downtown, midtown and uptown, and the neighborhood has plenty of local interest in itself. And all of this at a very affordable rate. I can't recommend Doti's place highly enough."

The room is immaculate as was the bathroom. Doti and her husband were attentive to our needs, friendly and made us feel very comfortable.  We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in New York City and hope to stay there again at some point.  Thank you, Doti, for helping to make our stay so special."

2528,7322,311202267,8/20/18,156248455,Mengchen,"Me and my husband just spent a wonderful weekend here. Kerry took a really good care of us. He welcomed us by the door when we arrived and gave us a lot of tips about how to visit New York. He prepared lovely breakfast and borrowed umbrella to us when raining. Itâ€™s just felt like home. The bedroom is bigger than I thought and the bed is comfortable. I will definitely choose here if I come back to New York in the future!"

2535,7726,301683829,8/4/18,63414260,Aoife,"This is a very cute little apartment close to the Nostrand stop on the blue line. The apartment is very spacious for a 1 bed and was perfect for my husband and I and our 11 month old baby. Adam and Charity kindly supplied us with a crib for the baby. The neighborhood is full of beautiful brownstones and Nostrand ave has a couple of small grocery stores just 5 minutes walk away. We didnâ€™t explore the neighborhood much as we headed to the waterfront each day. Itâ€™s just a short ride on the subway to downtown Brooklyn and amazing views of Manhattan. We recommend Brooklyn Bridge Park, part of which had just opened when we visited so we pretty much had the entire park to ourselves. "
2536,7726,303998115,8/8/18,205559034,Sonja,very nice basement apartment with lots of space and light! Great host! nice neighborhood!

The place is so lovely and spacious, and the decor and art are really terrific.  The bedroom is enormous!  The location is an easy walk to great bars, restaurants, and subway stations.   I will recommend this Airbnb to my friends and family in the future!"
2538,7726,309649634,8/18/18,6313095,Maria,We had a terrific stay in Brooklyn! The apartment is thoughtfully decorated and had everything we could need and more. Adam was easy to get in touch with for any questions we had and gave us some great restaurant recommendations. It was a hot couple of days when we visited and the A/C units were a godsend after walking around all day. The subway was a quick walk for our trips into Manhattan and the neighborhood felt safe and had plenty of options for dining and groceries. Highly recommend this Airbnb!
2539,7726,312984692,8/24/18,5447799,Darla,"I spent a week at Adam and Charitys place and it was quite lovely, thoughtfully decorated and really comfortable - the perfect first stop on my NYC tour. The bedroom is gorgeous and the bed comfortable. The kitchen was really useful and has everything you could possibly need to cook a meal. The backyard was stupendous with seating and a lush grassy yard. I had a couple of friends over for a dinner party and it was perfect. The location is in a beautiful part of Crown Heights, with close proximity to the express train to Manhattan. I would most certainly stay here again!"
2540,7726,320316533,9/8/18,186310797,Neha,"Location was perfect, loved the home. I would recommend people to stay here, Adam and Charity's place is wonderful."

2544,7801,7026,8/9/09,26220,Chi,"We stayed at Chaya's place for a week with our 2 kids. We had a wonderful time there, it was such a relief to have all that beautiful open space to come home to after an activity filled day in New York. The loft has a really peaceful feel to it, and it is surprisingly quiet during the night even though it is just around the corner from Bedford street. We loved the sauna, makes me wish we had one at home too... The apartment is well located, just a block or two from the L train, so getting to and from Manhattan is a breeze. "
2545,7801,8317,8/26/09,29070,Joshua & Gugulethu,This loft was incredible.  I last lived in NYC in a Soho sublet and Chaya's loft easily surpasses even that experience.  The kitchen had everything we needed.  The bed was wonderfully restful and the shag rug by the wall-sized projection system had memory foam underneath.  Not to mention the sauna.  And all this for less than what we were prepared to pay for the Hotel Chelsea.  My friends were blown away.  We hope our next vacation to NYC corresponds to one of Chaya's vacations. 
2546,7801,8591,8/30/09,31599,Opal,Simply AWESOME! We felt right at home at Chaya's loft.  It was clean and beautiful.  All the comforts of home. Maybe too comfortable.  We didn't want to leave! The location was perfect. WAY better than staying in a hotel room.  Worth every dime and then some. 
2547,7801,87811,8/31/10,173750,Sandra,
2548,7801,95077,9/12/10,71624,Petina,"Beautiful loft. The best place I've stayed in NYC. Hands Down! So many cool touches to the place. The kitchen is great and we had several dinners here. The rug is super comfy! The place was super clean.The loft is very close to the subway (1 stop from Manhattan). Bedford ave is full of interesting shops, bars and nightlife. nearby I recommend the following:shopping- Williamsburg flea market on saturdays, Bird, Megeating out: Diner, Marlow and Sons, Bozu, Walter's, Five Leaf, Fette Sau, Saltie, Egg, Pies n Thighsbars: Union Pool , Hotel Delmano, Brooklyn BowlI would definitely recommend this place to friends and stay here again."
2549,7801,164512,1/3/11,322540,Brent,"Nice place, and although I didn't meet Chaya, talked to her on the phone and we worked everything out great."
2550,7801,342116,6/29/11,439195,Molly,"Chaya's loft was in a perfect position for exploring both Brooklyn and Manhattan. We were slightly disappointed with the level of cleanliness when we arrived (we couldn't tell if the bed had fresh sheets or not, for instance), but that said, we had a comfortable and enjoyable stay over all.  Chaya gave us some good tips for the area. We ended up trying Best Pizza (on a night we had to stay in and wait for a lost bag to be delivered by an airline) and it was great. I can also highly recommend Diner for brunch! "
2551,7801,488222,8/30/11,703349,Les,"The photos don't do Chaya's place justice!  Without exaggerating, we couldn't believe our eyes when we first walked in.  It was huge, a very cool layout, and beautiful.  They have their own sauna!  Is this normal in Brooklyn?  We had 3 people in our party and visited at the end of august for 4 days/nights.  Hurricane Irene had caused nyc to shut down the mta and it looked likely we were going to spend 2 of the 4 days stuck inside.  Despite this, we were very thankful to have such a comfortable space that felt like home.  It was a very special trip and this space had a lot to do with that.  Thank you, Chaya!  Your place would be my number one choice to stay in NY!"
2552,7801,512801,9/8/11,244926,Ross,"Chaya's apartment  is amazing and even nicer than it looks in the photos.  The location was perfect for exploring Brooklyn and so close to the subway that you can be in Manhattan in no time at all. We also stayed in a nice hotel in SoHo on our trip but it didn't even compare to how good Chaya's place is, we would recommend it to everyone. Thank you."
2553,7801,809746,12/28/11,768779,Betsy,"We loved Chaya's apartment.  It is very well appointed including the kitchen which had everything I needed to cook up a storm.  The bed is so comfortable that it rivals my own at home.  We really loved the projector and watching football and movies on the huge wall.  The neighbors are very quiet, and the neighborhood is great and so quiet despite being just feet off of a main street. It is a perfect place to hang out even though getting away is easy with  the subway only two blocks away We are definitely planning on staying here again"
2554,7970,8077,8/23/09,25560,Susan,"This place is very very old but is kept very clean by the building manager. The air-con works intermittently, so the upper loft section gets very hot and unbearable to sleep in. If you don't mind old, then this place provides all the basics: a comfy bed, a shower, a fridge and a stove."
2555,7970,10951,9/21/09,34154,Bonnie And Ryan,"My parents actually stayed in this place and absolutly loved it, the location was perfect for them and the apartment was really clean and comfy. I'm sure they would recommend this place to anyone, especially an older couple like themselves who want to be in the thick of all the action for an action packed stay in the big apple. I would also like to thank Cee for letting me book the place for my parents. Cheers!"
2556,7970,16252,11/4/09,49693,Kevin,"This place is old but comfortable, I believe it would need a deep cleaning.  The only problem we had was the noise from the people above, seems like they never sleep.Having an elevator for 4th floor is a perk."
2557,7970,18039,11/22/09,54592,Andrea,I never saw cee but the super was really friendly. The room was old but very clean. Good neighborhood and close to many things and a short subway ride to others. We had four people with us so the price was good. 
2558,7970,33106,4/4/10,56283,Anjali,"I stayed there for a 2 night stay with 4 other friends (we were 5 adults total) and it was big enough. It is an old appartement that's for sure but it is very well located!!!! You can walk to Union square, Macy's, times square etc... The 2 double beds were comfy but the sofa was terrible as per my friend...I also believe that it would need a deep cleaning. I would suggest that people brings their own towels and sheets in order to avoid (Website hidden by Airbnb) conclude I would say that for the price we paid, it is worth it!"
2559,7970,39208,5/1/10,112120,Christina,"Good price for a cute rental. I stayed for 4 nights. It is an older rental, however most of the apartments in New York are. I was happy with it. I was easily able to reach Cee when I needed her, which was nice. I was happy to have a small kitchen with a fridge and microwave for leftovers.Very nice neighborhood. Easy walk to attractions.Overall, I was very happy with everything."
2560,7970,58532,6/28/10,85711,Christopher,"Cee was very helpful and responsive leading up to and during the trip.  The location is ideal for walking around the city and seeing all the sites and destination locations.  The place is pretty much exactly as pictured--its not a brand new place--but it has city charm and we had everything we could need right there in the apartment for a visit to NYC.  Excellent visit and a great place to stay for several people!  We had 3, but easily sleeps 4, and upwards of 6 if pressed.  Would gladly stay here again!"
2561,7970,279919,5/24/11,600077,Jay,"The apartment was great. Good location and easy to find. The super was a bit clueless and slow, but it didn't bother me. The cleaning guy was real nice. The place was supposed to be ready at 3pm and we had to wait until 4pm. That's the only complaint. It appeared as if noone actually lives there. "
2562,7970,298154,6/5/11,496090,Mary Jane,This is a well-located apartment in Chelsea with plenty of space for my adult daughter and (Website hidden by Airbnb) was clean and comfortable - kind of basic but fine.  
2563,7970,337339,6/27/11,599445,Olivier,"It was a great experience of N.Y.C staying in this apartment. It is well located. You can go to most of the places to be seen by foot in N.Y.C. The team who manages the building is really fun with a real N.Y.C accent. We were proposed to let our luggages in their office in the basement for the last day so that we could enjoy few more hours the city. Size of the appartment is Ok for three people, you do not feel like a rabbit in his cage ;). Conclusion : good place even if building a bit old."
2564,7970,434905,8/10/11,822087,Alessandra,"Perfect solution to live and visit New York, very near to everything (the Flatiron building really behind the corner, and the delicious hamburgers of Shake Shak too!), metro and bus just a few minutes. The house was very clean, confortable, nice, spacious. We were 3 and we staied very very well! Out of the window you can see the Empire State Building! :) I really reccomend this solution!"
2565,7970,732249,11/20/11,1098816,Soledad,"Cee apartment is great! Really comfortable and great location! "
2566,7970,794334,12/19/11,1486617,Eleanor,"Cee's place was as advertised - well-located, basic -- and fit our needs. The bed was uncomfortable, the lighting was dim, and the apartment could use a deep clean. If you have back problems or are looking for a nice spot to hang out, look elsewhere. But if you want a reasonable, convenient crash pad for up to 5 people, this is your place. Cee was responsive to questions via email, and though she was not around, the super let us in with no problems. Bring earplugs for street noise. "
2567,7970,1005183,3/17/12,1418052,Jess,"Perfect location. Right in the centre of everything. You really can see the Empire State Building from the window & at he weekend there is a great flea market across the street.We really enjoyed our stay and would definately return."
2568,7970,1311663,5/20/12,2335423,Patty,"We stayed in two places during our long weekend in NY. This place was the better of the two - even if the other one was technically ""nicer."" This place is bigger than the pictures imply, and the big bed, which isn't shown in these pics, was very comfy. Cee was very nice and responded quickly when there was a little snafu with the keys. The price is great. I'd definitely stay here again before I'd ever stay in a hotel or another apartment on this site. "
2569,7970,2581243,10/11/12,3504600,Dominic,"This is an amazing, central location to all you would want to see in Manhattan!  One block from beautiful Madison Square Park, lots of activity, a 2-minute walk to the N,Q,R subway, 15-minute walk to Times Square, and Eataly is right nearby (get your morning latte there every day!).  The building management is really nice and helpful and when the sink in the bathroom had a leak, they were right on top of getting it fixed.  Cee was quick to respond to everything and answered whatever questions we had before we arrived.  It's an old building so some water temp changes and squeaky floors are to be expected.  The apartment could use a bit of an update (some of the furniture feels well-worn, the ""loft"" is more of a crawl space, and the kitchen doesn't really inspire use) but you should be out exploring anyway so for the price it's totally worth it.  By no means is this to say it's a dump...just don't expect the Ritz.  This place is more ideal for explorers rather than those looking for a romantic getaway.  It's a great spot, comfortable enough, and in a very safe area...with very nice people attached (Cee and the management)."
2570,7970,2728847,10/27/12,3407428,StÃ©phane,Location was just perfect! Very close to Broadway and 5th Avenue. Flat is a bit old and could be cleaner. It was big enough for all 3 of us. Very quiet at night which was a good surprise!

2572,7970,3541202,2/14/13,4805632,Nacho,"Aunque no conocimos a Cee, los encargados del edificio nos atendieron perfectamente. La localizaciÃ_n del apartamento es magnÃ_fica, a un paseo de Times Square, en un barrio esplÃ©ndido, donde hay un montÃ_n de lugares con mÃºsica en vivo (en la 26), supermercados, etc. La Ãºnica pega seria es la conexiÃ_n a internet, que es sÃ_lo por cable y no pudimos conectar los mÃ_viles por wifi, pero es tal y como aparece en las fotos, con vistas al Empire State desde la cama. De todas formas, es un apartamento muy recomendable."
2573,7970,3953521,3/30/13,61128,Veronica,"Great Location to everything.  Keys were there and delivered by the super.  My only thing was that it did need a little updating.  Coffee maker was probably from the 1970 and still had used coffee grind from, i guess, the previous renter. :( if we are paying for cleaning fees, than i would expect everything cleaned.. sorry..But the location was great.

2576,7970,5018270,6/8/13,2032385,Nadine,"The location of the apartment is perfect ! There are more than enough subway stations in the area. The apartment itself is cozy and nice. Although it could use some renovation here and there,  it was clean  and we felt at home. You can hear the elevator but that's only the first night, then you get used to the sound. Clean Towels and linen were  provided. The super is very nice and helps right away if he's needed! We left our bags in the basement and could fully enjoy the last day in Manhattan. (The view of the Empire State Building right outside the window every morning and every night wasn't bad either )  We'd like to come back and we recommend Cee's place to friends and family!"

2578,7970,7162599,9/9/13,4109169,Yvonne,"Great location indeed! This apartment is just as it says in the write-up and comments made.  It is a great experience of true NYC.  I would just advise if you are sensitive to mattresses (a.k.a. back/neck issues), the mattress is old and lumpy and not supportive and the pillows are awful.  If you were to bring your own pillow, you may be better off.  I agree with the other reviews that an uplift may be in order....but if you just want an easy place to stay that is super convenient, this is the place for you!"
2579,7970,7708890,9/30/13,4925156,Yury,Very good location! Nice place in the heart of the city. We had a good time at this comfortable flat.
2580,7970,8308587,10/25/13,7687446,Julie,"After spending ten nights in this apartment I guess it grew on us ..we did have a few problems which included .The wifi dropping out constantly ..which was our main source of communication with family and friends ...the appliances where very old or non existence (hope the new toaster we brought stays for other guests) ..the toilet was a big problem overflowing and running constantly after talking with Winston who was always on hand to fix it for us ..it was a issue in the rest of the building I tried to contact Cee and got her sister instead who was happy to send her father around to fix things if Winston couldn't ... The bedding could be upgraded putting two flat pillows inside one case not my idea of comfort. However you can't beat the location and if you want to experience a real old New York appartment then give it a go ..after all it's the experience that makes a holiday for me ...Cee take note of all the other reviews about the cleanliness and comfort of your guests and this would be a great place to stay...probably only cost you one nights rent .. I would just like to thank Winston for all his help we found him very friendly and helpful Cheers the girls from OZ "

2584,7970,13757945,6/3/14,2237099,Charis,"Starting off with the positives. The location is perfect, the house is big enough for three people and clean, and the host and live-in super were friendly and helpful. The house is however kind of old. On our last night we had accidentally left a bag with some unfinished food next to the trashcan and unfortunately we found 2 mice in the kitchen area that night. That was partly our fault but we think it is something we should mention. "
2585,7970,27139607,2/26/15,5313420,Pauline,"The appartment has an ideal location in NY, very central if you want to visit most of the neighbourhoods of the city.But i must say we were expecting a much cleaner appartment especially because of the important cleaning fees we had to pay. The floor needed vacuming, the dishes were a bit sticky and the overall atmosphere did not appear very clean. Some people might also be disturbed by the noise. (Upstairs neighbor and lift) We did not get the opportunity to meet the host but the super was welcoming and let us in when we arrived and also offered to keep our bags on our last day so that we could enjoy the city."

I also loved the burnt down chruch across the street. The Antique fairs during the weekend were a great morning activity. Cee was really helpful with the stay. Her and Winston made sure we had everything we needed! "

2593,8024,27706,2/27/10,66682,Dimitri,"We stayed for 12 days at CBG and it was like a second home for us. The place is close from everything (subway) in a really nice neighbourood.We loved walking arouns in park Slope and the 5th Av is full of nice little shops.Lisel and Seija were great ! We had breakfast at home and sometimes diner when the day was exhausting !More over, we had our flight back cancelled in the middle of the night because of the snow, it was 4AM and we knew we could come back in the middle of the night at Cbg.Like your home away from home I told you !"
2594,8024,42868,5/16/10,34986,Ann-Michele,"We had an fine long weekend experience at Cbg in Park Slope. Our bedroom was downstairs bedroom right off an entry way which really suited our needs. Our bed was very comfortable and the ceiling fan was a lovely addition. The downstairs bathroom was just down the hall near the kitchen and garden. And -- what a  wonderful garden!!The area is perfect for anyone intersted in small shops, good coffee and easy access to the subway.  On Saturday night, we used the seating area right off the kitchen to chat with friends while another guest cooked a late dinner. It all worked. This is an easy, welcoming home.Lisel was a delight and we intend to come back in a few months. "

2596,8024,63206,7/10/10,158230,Mark,"We recently spent a week at the Cbg Guest house in Brooklyn.  A wonderful experience for a family -- 3 kids under 11 -- with Lisel as an attentive and gracious hostess.  The neighborhood is great with lots going on, good food choices and a nice coffee shop on the corner to get you going in the morning.  Getting around all of NYC is really easy as well with subway access within a 10 minute walk. The room and beds were great and it was really nice to have access to a full kitchen.  I highly  recommend the Cbg Guest house for people wanting to have access to NYC from a neighborhood base.  We will be coming back."
2597,8024,88225,9/1/10,164917,Christina,My stay at Lisel's lovely guest house has been the perfect transition home away from home that I needed.  She has decorated her house so that you want to take a seat and stay for awhile.  I have met some incredible house guests and we've taken to going out on the town or cooking dinner together.  You will be pleasantly pleased by all that is offered. CV
2598,8024,102127,9/21/10,164016,Mike,What a lovely stay. Both Linda and I felt at home and we were. I would recommend at stay at Lisel's home.  
2599,8024,119881,10/15/10,249615,Jayanthilal,The host canceled my reservation 14 days before arrival.
2600,8024,123829,10/21/10,240897,Sandra,"Lisel's place is very comfortable and quiet. My husband, my mother, my 18 month old and I were quite happy to stay there. Even though the rooms we were in were not entirely private, it was always very quiet. And our fellow guests were a nice mix of people, and all very courteous. "
2601,8024,126647,10/25/10,248013,Lauren,"My husband and I really enjoyed our short stay here. The house is filled with books and artsy clutter. Lisel and Seija are friendly and very pleasant hosts. We also ate breakfast at Seija's vegan restaurant, Sun in Bloom. Delicious.Lisel is generous and welcoming. The house is clean, the bed in the first floor front bedroom very comfortable. We had a very quiet night, with the exception of a car alarm. The bathroom situation is quirky, with a shower just off the living room and the teensiest powder room in the world, but it just takes a little flexibility and good humor to adjust.Great, quiet but fun Park Slope neighborhood--a bookbinder a couple doors away, coffee shop, all sorts of restaurants around the corner on Fifth. We had a Colombian lunch at Bogota and a wonderful supper at Alchemy. It's just a few short blocks to the Bergen St. subway station. Be advised there are two Bergen St. stations! "
2602,8024,139254,11/15/10,102951,Lori,"Clean friendly cozy and very convenient. Not fancy, but very homey.  Lisel the owner does serious community work for Haiti relief. Large  shared kitchen. Like staying in someone's home, which it is. Perfect for visiting family for a few days. Lisel is very gracious and conscientious and fixed room mix- up immediately. Large stone shower. I'd stay here again for sure. Thanks!"
2603,8024,146982,11/30/10,210616,Peggy,A wonderful experience.  Lisel couldn't have been more gracious and welcoming.  The bed was super comfortable and the location was perfect.  
2604,8024,154742,12/16/10,295664,Noelle,My friend & I stayed in the CBJ Guest House for 5 days last week. Lisel was very welcoming and helpful with places to see in the area. The room was extremely comfortable. Great location as well!!! Great access to the subway & awesome restaurants all within walking distance. I highly recommend staying here to future guests. 
2605,8024,164548,1/3/11,307240,Han,"We got the main bedroom on the third floor. The room is amazingly colorful and lovely. I fell in love with the blue color and the paintings on the walls by local artists. She is an artist!!! And as we asked, there was a IKEA daybed set up for my friend. We got clean bed clothes and even clean towers!!! It was very cozy 4 days staying in the house. The subway is within 5 mins walking distance. So it's actually a good place to stay for visiting NYC but wanting to avoid the crowds in Manhattan. There's some lovely little restaurants around. And you can get bagel and coffee very early in the morning with a little walk less than 3 mins!!! Anyway, I'll definitely recommend this house to my friends."
2606,8024,172285,1/18/11,335150,Amber,"I reached out to CBG with a unique request. I was looking to host a cooking party with 15 of my closest friends hosted by a personal chef. I live in the city but my apartment really isn't conducive to that type of experience. I planned to host at a friend's place but something came up and they canceled on me 3 days before I was supposed to have the event. Another friend referred me to this site and I came across CBG. After pitching my unique request, Lisel got back to me immediately and said she'd be happy to have me. She made everything very convenient for me & my guests and there were no issues getting what was needed - it was overall a wonderful exchange. The only drawback (& why I'm giving 4 stars vs. 5) is the kitchen is a little cluttered. Granted there were a few of us packed in but you can tell the house has been occupied for a while. Overall, it was a great experience. I'd recommend CBG to anyone in the future."
2607,8024,231565,4/19/11,410973,Alessandro,"Good atmosphere and host very kind. Very good location, in 30min you are in the center.Thank you very much!"
2608,8024,249484,5/3/11,385209,Danny,Our time at Lisel's guest house was amazing!  We were in town for a conference and she was very accomodating for our large group.  Half of our group needed to stay another night and Lisel was very helpful in switching some things around to make it work for us.  The location was amazing and was very close to everything Park Slope had to offer.  The home was clean yet comfy and had a full kitchen for our use.  Our group of 9 had plenty of hot water for showers and we were able to come and go as we please.  We were treated like family and will definitely be back next time we're in Brooklyn!
2609,8024,257491,5/9/11,552098,Katrina,"Great host, super accommodating. Booked for a business stay and was totally pleased. "
2610,8024,276369,5/23/11,509795,Carol,"It's difficult to describe the Community Be Good Guesthouse because it is a very different experience than many of us are used to, especially when traveling in New York City.  It's more like staying with a friend you've never met before than staying in a B & B.  I looked all over the Park Slope area for a place for my Mom, husband and I to stay near where my daughter lives for her college graduation.  Finding a single room for three people in NYC is nearly impossible (and extremely expensive to take two rooms).  The traditional B & B's in Park Slope all had terrible reviews for friendliness and helpfulness - in fact they all seemed obnoxious, which was borne out when I called one of them.  Then I discovered Airbnb and the CBG Guesthouse.  From the first contact, Lesal was friendly, direct, helpful, accommodating.  If you need luxury, this is not the place to stay, but if you want to feel like family and talk with an engaging, intelligent, thoughtful and wise woman and be in a wonderful area at a really reasonable price, this is a gem!  Although it requires suspending the ""hotel"" mentality, we all (including my 82 year old mother) thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay there again in an instant (despite the ""smallest bathroom in the world"" and shower in the office space).   Thanks to Lesal and Cecilio and all who make this wonderful space possible!"
2611,8024,285668,5/28/11,536866,Ryan,"I had a very comfortable stay here at the guest house. Great hospitality, great home and a very quick response on short notice. The area is also a big plus located in downtown area."
2612,8024,349516,7/3/11,596908,Judy,"This is a wonderful house on a tree lined street in Brooklyn close to subways, and lots of great restaurants, shops and coffee houses.  It is clean and comfortable with a beautiful back garden and a full kitchen that guests may use.  The host is friendly but not overbearing.  I highly recommend it."
2613,8024,371099,7/13/11,731585,Fenella,"Lisel was such a warm and inviting hostess. My friends drove me down to Brooklyn to help me find a place to live, and Lisel was incredibly insightful and quick to share advice and contacts with us. The house provided all of the necessary amenities like wifi, a clean, shared, bathroom and kitchen. It's close to several great cafes, restaurants and grocery stores. I would certainly recommend this Guest Home to young travellers, and those who enjoy a space that harbors community and connection. Thanks, Lisel! "
2614,8024,399135,7/26/11,191466,Ken,"Lisle was fantastic. Very helpful and accommodating. The other guests were quiet and respectful. I have used AirBnb and stayed in Guest Houses before and this house was unique in my experience. Although the house has a 'wild' and eclectic feel with a tremendous number of books and art objects there was also a very strong sense of order and cleanliness.We travel to NYC 3-5 times a year and have friends in the neighborhood and are hoping that we will have the opportunity to stay again.  "
2615,8024,406838,7/30/11,200616,Sandra,"Our stay at Lisel's was great.  I needed to add a room at the last minute. She was so accommodating. My family really enjoyed her home. It is very different from what they're accustomed to. For me, I found there is so much information in the host and the home. If you're an avid reader, you will find much joy in the abundance of literature there. This is a great place for family and good friends to stay. I would definitely stay there again.Another good note, Lisel is very passionate in her service to community both near and far. I enjoy people who are unselfish in their plight to serve those that are less fortunate."
2616,8024,428535,8/8/11,773897,Angelique,"Cozy and charming, the community be good guesthouse was everything we could have wanted in a home away from home for our 3 day stay.  Lisel and friends were incredibly accommodating, the place was clean and cheery and the neighborhood was fantastic.   "

There are two subway stations nearby and in the 5th Street round the corner are many nice bars, cafes, restaurants and shops.The people living at the guest house are very open and friendly.There were two things they were not convenient. From our room (we had room #2) was only a thin wall with a window to the neighbour room. When our neighbour came late at night we heard him and our room was light as at daytime ... There are also only three bathrooms for all the guest rooms an the people living there. This is may be a little too less."

2625,8024,651918,10/22/11,1119971,Kathryn,"Aside from being a cozy, comfortable accommodation, located in a wonderful and lively neighborhood, Cbg Guest House provided myself, my husband and our two teenagers with a great place to meet up with other like minded folks. We came to the area to investigate possible universities for the young men.  Lisel was a wonderful resource.  She not only shared her knowledge of the area, but she also shared her life experiences and even a book!!! When leaving, we felt as if we'd found a home away from home. It also felt good to know that some of the money paid went to help re-build Haiti. So much better that a corporate hotel!!!!!!"
2626,8024,699547,11/7/11,1102783,Jenifer,Starting to feel like a home away from home at Lisel's - thank you so much for having us again!
2627,8024,1070714,4/2/12,89193,Susan,I came with a Mother/Daughter group of 5 moms and 5 teenage daughters.  It was a great place for us to stay- relaxed and homey.  We really appreciated  cooking our meals in the kitchen and gathering to chat in the dining room.  The location of comtybegood is fantastic.  It's only a few blocks to the subway and only a block or two to shopping and restaurants.  Lisel was very welcoming and friendly.  We would love to come back and stay here in the future.

There was a large variety of restaurants within easy walking distance. We also walked to the beautiful Prospect Park (the Brooklyn Botanic Garden was wonderful!) and over to the Brooklyn Academy of Music for a film.  It was easy to access the subway to Manhattan, too.  Though we go to NYC fairly often, it was our first stay over in Park Slope and we plan to do it again!"
2630,8024,3273157,1/5/13,2359781,Christine,Lisel was a very friendly Host. We loved the neighborhood and all the very good inexpensive restaurants very close to the house. We were two families with 7 children and everyone felt like he was at home !

CBG is a super place in a great location.Lisel was a super host and setup comfortable rooms for all of us. The accommodations were great.  CBG is a charming house & a readers paradise - I have never seen that many books in 1 house.We also loved the neighborhood; many coffee shops & restaurants and only a short walk to the metro to Manhatten.  We even walked across the Brooklyn bridge into Manhatten.  I recommend CBG without reservation !"
2634,8024,5668728,7/10/13,6221475,Alice,"Lisel is a friendly person, her house has big rooms with a lovely garden. It is close to the metro. A great coffee shop is just around the corner with fresh brioches and muffins. Thanks Lisl."

The house is architecturally interesting with lots of ornamental detail in the house and well-proportioned rooms with high ceilings.Our host Dupree was very friendly and accommodating. We are a family of five, man and wife with 3 children and were offered 2 rooms for our stay with access to a large kitchen, bathroom, and garden terrace out back. "

2640,8024,8015763,10/13/13,941907,Vigdis,"For our group of four adult couples, this accomodation was a good choice. We enjoyed both the noise and excitement of the big City and Park Slope with all its quirky little shops and restaurants. The weather was great, and we were lucky to stay at Liesl's and have access to her garden.The beds were comfortable and the living was easy at Liesl's place. We are in awe of her ardent work for humanitarian causes, and the fact that one contributes to her projects by choosing her guesthouse makes the stay all the more pleasant."

The location is very convenient with several train stations close by (5min walk) and the neighborhood is great, charming streets, very safe and with a lot of good restaurants and coffee places to go to. We were a large group of 10 adults and kids and the house was very convenient with plenty of rooms and bathrooms. "

La comunidad esta muy bien situada, cerca de una estacion de trenes que te llevan directamente a Manhattan. Me senti como en una gran familia y si alguna vez volvemos a Nueva York sin duda alguna volveremos a repetir  con ella."

Feeling so good!!The area is also very welcoming: quiet and safe streets with beautiful trees, some pubs and the supermarket 1 minute walk from Lisel's house.We are in Brooklyn real life! Lisel's house is also very closed to Atlantic avenue subway station where most of Brooklyn trains stop. It's very convenient to go anywhere. This is also very closed to Barclay's center hosting Brooklyn Nets NBA games (great in case you are fond of Basket-ball).Well, we will be very happy to visit Lisel back when our boys will be old enough to  visit such an amazing city.Thanks a lot for this wonderful week in NYC!"

The neighborhood is really nice, there are tons of restaurants and bars around.I'll definitely keep this place in mind for future visits!"
2650,8024,18332148,8/25/14,18735734,Krystian,"The neighborhood was very pleasant, easy to access cafes,  bars and various shops and stores on foot, plus there's a little mall and a few subway stations nearby. The area is also very green and quiet. The host was nice and accommodating. The apartment will be awesome for voracious readers, basically every wall is full of books. The facilities are all in working order. The place was clean though a little cluttered, which I personally like. One negative point or maybe a tip for future travelers - if you're a tall person, and you're sleeping in the extra bed / cot, ask the host about its exact dimensions and decide accordingly - my body adopted by the second night ;) Because the place is big, you can usually expect a few travelers, so that gives you a sort of privacy through numbers, which is also something a lot of people would like. If you want to socialize with the host or boarders, there are common areas with usually some interesting people to talk to. "
2651,8024,19117653,9/7/14,5282793,Rachel,Lisel was very welcoming and flexible in accommodating our large party (10).

Bathroom was super clean and the kitchen had everything we needed for cooking. The backyard was great. The room was not exactly as in the pictures regarding furniture and the wall needs painting, everything looks much more worn and old. Anyway, it is in a nice neighborhood, with lots of restaurants and very close to multiple subway stations. "

The house is so cosy, clean, efficient and in a lovely neighborhood, although I stayed there for only one night, but I absolutely loved it. The room that I shared with two other friends had TV, clean sheets and towels. Lisel showed us around, introduced us to other airbnb guests and welcomed us into her house with open arms. I would absolutely stay there again. "

There is plenty of space in the backyard to relax and hammock when the weather is nice. You have access to the kitchen, fridge, coffee.

2711,8025,554773,9/21/11,1104139,Shaun,"Lisel organised for us to stay with Fiona and Daniel in Marlborough Road. While this was a little further away (20-30min subway to Manhattan) we could not have been happier with our stay. They have a lovely old house an easy (5min) walk to the subway (Q and B lines). The family were welcoming and wonderful hosts, often offering us advise on sights to see, local places to eat and how to travel about town. The bedroom we stayed in was large and clean with a comfortable double bed and an ensuite with a shower over a large tub.  We could not recommend this lovely family more highly."
2712,8025,664060,10/25/11,29417,Elizabeth,"I found the overall vibe of the guesthouse to be warm, welcoming and worldly - an ideal combination for a visit to the Big Apple. Park Slope is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Cbg guesthouse is in a great spot with so many great restaurants close by. The 2, 3, B and Q are all within a 6 or 7 min walk, so Manhattan is just a few stops away.Lisel provides a great guesthouse with a great cause; I wholeheartedly recommend staying here. Bathrooms are shared, but kept so clean you feel like it's your own, and the kitchen is great for cooking or storing leftovers. Needless to say, I'm a fan and would stay here again in a new York minute."

The bed was clean and comfy, the kitchen warm and welcoming and the garden truly a treat after a long day indoors in Manhattan! And not to mention tres pratique! Near great coffee and every train station you will ever need.And it's so nice to know a portion of the fee goes to Haiti. I will stay there again and again...hope there's room, Lisel!"

Lisel, the host, although busy with her community work suggested various things  for me to do which I didn't have the time to take up, unfortunately.  It was good to be able to sit in the sunny backyard and watch the squirrels and see a different part of NY - as well as meet some locals and other guests. Really easy access to the Atlantic St \Barclay Centre subway and you can get anywhere fast. "

The room itself was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The house itself was also eclectic and I couldn't help but gaze at the various books and cultural artifacts that rested quietly on the shelves. Overall a good experience. Thanks Lisel!

Betsy was at work when we arrived, but she left us a key so we could get in to the house before heading to Manhattan. Both the house and room were very nice. The location is very conveniently located -- close to at least two different subway stations. We only spent one night, but when asked to leave our luggage at the house on the second day so we wouldn't have to carry it around New York, they let us do so. The only thing that caught us off guard was that we had to move from Betsy's house to Lisel's (only a short walk down the street) at 11am after our night, and we were still asleep because of the late New Year's celebrations. It wasn't that big a deal; it just surprised us. "

The place is very quiet and everything is in working condition. With a fully stocked pantry there are full amenities through out the house for what ever your needs. A great location with lots of cafe/bars/ restaurants /and the famous Barclay centre just down the road.  transpotation is near by and using other shared services Uber/ Lfyt /car service/taxi are easily accessible. I wish we could of stayed around longer to partake in this old character brownstone. Thx for your patience. JahLuV.)

We had a great time and feel very fortunate to have found such a lovely place.  The Citybegood house is an original brownstone with a bohemian vibe. Lisel et al are great people, with inspiring community values who really welcomed us and were always attentive and interested in our needs while respecting our space.The Slope area in Brooklyn is a fantastic, thriving and buzzy place. Thereâ€™s a great place for coffee as well as restaurants, and a large grocery store just at the bottom of the road, literally seconds away. The Subway is less than 5 minutes away and it only takes 10 minutes to Manhattan. We all had a great time with music and dance at Brooklyn museum, which has a free open evening the first Saturday of the month. If youâ€™re more interested in community values rather than posh hotels then this is for you. "
2740,8110,30664,3/21/10,94093,Mary Ellen,  Great location in the heart of Park Slope !  Very easy to check in and check out.  We would stay here again.

The area is beautiful, surrounded by nice restaurants, coffee places, and very close to all subways that can take you into the city in a matter of minutes. Lisel is very involved in social movements, which is inspiring and makes your stay with her so much more meaningful. "
2742,8110,46278,5/25/10,114188,Lauren,"Lisel is very accommodating and very prompt to answer any questions - fast response to my emails. The brownstone is in a beautiful area of Park Slope with easy access to subways and shops.  We came and went with ease.  Thank you, Lisel!"
2743,8110,50332,6/6/10,57953,Kevin,"Absolutely wonderful! It was such a joy to spend the weekend here.  It's a unique and comfy space, a large rambling house with an enormous back yard, but Lisel's hospitality is what makes this so special. I don't think I've ever felt so at home while traveling."
2744,8110,106393,9/27/10,214895,Rosalba,"My husband and I had a very nice stay at Lisel's Cbg Guest House.  Our taxi cab was just taking off when I heard somebody saying, ""Bienvenidos!""  Lisel was waiting for us at the doorsteps, which made me feel at home immediately.  Cbg #2 room was clean and comfy and eclectically decorated.  She placed an additional sofa for our visitor daughters and asked me to choose a throw from her Guatemalan blankets.  We could use the kitchen freely and visitors are welcomed.  If you like to do yoga, there is a by donation place 2.5 blocks from the Guest House, and lots of places to eat or to have a cup of coffee. I heard from a couple of people that the best coffee in the neighborhood happens to be a few steps from Cbg. She is surrounded by nice & helpful people (Seija, Tasha, Cecilio, Martha, & Cheryl) We would go back to this place without hesitation.  Lisel: You were gone when we left, but thank you much  for your hospitality!  Jesus & Rosalba"
2745,8110,117846,10/12/10,252819,Stephanie,"CBg Guest House was a great find. Lisel's terrific: kind, welcoming, curious about her guests but not intrusive, and ready with good advice about where to get good local coffee etc. She and the house are both very hospitable. The home and garden are relaxed, lived-in-but-clean, comfortable spaces. It's not for someone looking for a hotel-ish experience; more like staying with a really lovely friend-of-a-friend. Transportation to Manhattan is also a breeze, with a number of subway lines an easy walk away. I'll stay here again!"
2746,8110,126023,10/24/10,214835,Christy,"I stayed in the front room on the middle floor @ CBG. Slept like a baby in the most comfortable bed ever. The room was comfy & warm. The other room on that floor doesn't have a window, which would be a drag. Didn't see the downstairs rooms, but the German couple who was staying there seemed happy. The bathroom on the 2nd floor is tiny & the shower is in the living room (very odd), but the other bathroom on the 1st floor is lovely and big (with an accessible shower if you need it). Nice big kitchen if you want to cook for yourself or hang out with the other guests. The location was absolutely perfect for me - I don't really know anything about NYC and was a little nervous about walking around alone at night in Brooklyn. Park Slope is sort of upper middle class hipster chic - lots of indie bakeries, coffee shops & boutiques. Strollers everywhere. You're in between 3 or 4 subway stations & a short walk from the LIRR from JFK. Couldn't be more convenient. There's a grocery store across the street & a Target a couple of blocks away if you forgot anything. Lisel is super nice, though we only met once. Only thing odd is that it's kind of like staying in your aunt's spare room, but you have to pay her $130 - that's what AirBNB is for, though. For me it was definitely worth it as a single woman who wanted safety & convenience. If you're more familiar with Brooklyn or traveling in a group you could probably stay in a dodgier neighborhood cheaper. Still cheaper than any hotel you'll ever find. Highly recommended. Thanks, Lisel!"
2747,8110,223347,4/11/11,358693,Jugurtha,"Cbg Guest House is very warm, serene abode. Its location is ideal: it gives one immediate access to 5th Avenue's section Union-Street-to-15th-Street-and-above area. At the same time, it gives one access to the Vanderbilt, Atlantic, etc., Avenues' universe. Even more important, it is just a couple blocks from Prospect Park. What's not to like. Quality eating places and specialty-coffee store abound. So do the subway stops. Lisel is an extraordinarily welcoming, laid-back yet thorough, alert landlady. Every single aspect of my experience has been perfect. Highly recommended."
2748,8110,335870,6/26/11,572934,Sarah,"CBG was a lovely place to stay - as others have said, it's a home away from home. I recently travelled alone from Australia to NY and of the three places I stayed during my trip this was definitely the best. Lisel allowed me to book a room at CBG on short notice and was very welcoming. I didn't see much of her as I was not there for long and she had her own business to attend to, however, from the conversations we had, I found her to be an interesting and friendly person. The house itself is really cute and full of colourful, hippy charm. There is a gorgeous garden out back, big kitchen, great shower, comfortable rooms, lots of paintings, mosaics and books. I stayed in the front room (downstairs) and although I was only there one night it was the little sanctuary I needed after such a long and stressful trip getting to NY. I was able to come and go as I pleased without infringing upon anyone (I spent the night out with friends and returned quietly and easily at 4am through the lower level entrance right next to my room). Lisel allowed me to stay late into the following afternoon so I could wait for a friend to come meet me. The bed was comfortable and Lisel provided both towels and toiletries. The area itself, Park Slope, is a beautiful part of Brooklyn - I wish I could've stayed longer to explore it more. For anyone who is unsure of where to stay in Brooklyn due to safety or cost, this place is definitely value for money and it is located in one of the nicest and safest areas of Brooklyn. The subway station is 2 mins up the road. I went walking here alone both during the day and night (4am from main st back to CBG) and found it to be a very quiet, safe and interesting area. There are plenty of shops, places to eat, friendly people, beautiful Brownstones, trees and birds. All in all a great place to stay, I highly recommend CBG and I will hopefully be back next time I come to NY.  "
2749,8110,465183,8/22/11,564412,Cecile,"A great homely address ! We were a real tribe, coming from France with four adults et five children, and everybody found his place in this great and friendly house. Lisel is a very kind host, ready to give you some advice for your visit. And the location in Brooklyn, with the wild little garden, is perfect to rest after long walks in Manhattan. We hope to come again. Cecile & co."

Lisel was kind enough to help us when we needed a place to stay. Unfortunately Lisel was away, so we met by Roman who was friendly and very accommodating.The big disappointment (aside from not being able to stay longer) was not getting a chance to meet Lisel as she has quite an eclectic library.

2756,8110,754096,11/29/11,1389847,Melissa,We were lucky to find a place to stay so close to our daughter in Brooklyn.  It was really fun to actually see the inside of a brownstone!  We don't have such things in Texas.  Our bed was comfortable and the water was hot in the shower.  What more could we ask for?
2757,8110,765676,12/5/11,1430838,Sarah,Had a very nice stay at the Cbg Guest House.  It is very comfortable and so conveniently located.  Accomodated my family of 4 perfectly for a one-night trip to Brooklyn.  Hope to stay their again soon.
2758,8110,780355,12/12/11,1449851,Nathanael,"Our host was extremely nice and the location could not have been better, just off of 5th Avenue in Park Slope and within easy access of the 1/9 trains and easy walking distance of the Atlantic/Pacific hub. And 5th Avenue is the place to be in Park Slope with all the best restaurants and nightlife. The Key Food just down the street is a great resource that you can use if planning to cook in the well-stocked kitchen. We were in town for a wedding and my mother-in-law had some issues with the place she had been supposed to stay, and Lisel was extremely helpful in our efforts to find a place for my mother-in-law (the mother of the bride, in fact)--and in the end, my mother-in-law stayed here, too. CBG is a little unconventional in their approach--as Lisel put it ""we're a little quirky, but if you like quirky we a great place to stay."" I like quirky and we had a great experience. On top of that, the CBG mission (helping those in need in Haiti) is admirable and I am glad that some of the money I paid is going to that cause. I would certainly stay here again."

We were due in NYC in just a couple of days, and had experienced a cancellation from another host,  so we were very grateful for Cbg being available and helpful at the last minute. Lisel was very friendly and I greatly appreciate her involvement with helping the poor in Haiti.  Her fascinating and eclectic home was welcoming almost to a fault - I felt a bit like I was intruding in her personal space.  We were just there to sleep and bathe, so we didn't use the kitchen or backyard garden, but they were lovely as well."

We were unprepared for the sudden heatwave, but the next day a window air-conditioner had been installed. We loved meeting the other guests, especially the families. Loved the garden and the hammocks. The neighbourhood is vibrant with so many excellent places to eat. It was an oasis to return home to after the mayhem of Manhattan. We enjoyed exploring Brooklyn. The Museum was wonderful as was our visit to the Wyckoff Farmhouse. Loved chatting with Lisel. I'll return again for sure! Thank-you for making us feel so at homel!"

The convenient location was the primary factor in making our determination to stay here, but the friendly atmosphere and comfortable room made it a very nice stay. "
2767,8110,6174783,8/2/13,6562197,Brooke,"We stayed with Lisel for a little over a month while looking for a permanent place to live in Brooklyn. If you are staying more than a few nights, expect to become part of the household. The front room is large, and you will have your privacy whenever you wish. Lisel is a fascinating woman, and does some amazing charitable and community work both in NY and Haiti. If you desire, you'll have the chance for some interesting conversation or to read something from the formidable collection of books in the house.CBG feels more like an eclectic share house than a guest house, which was great for us, but may not suit everyone. As part of a household, you might need to be flexible. Lisel asked me to move rooms for a few nights around July 4th so she could accommodate a family who had nowhere else to stay. Sure, that might be a tad inconvenient, but as I found out later, I was actually moving to Lisel's own room while she slept on a cot in the basement in order to accommodate everyone who needed a place to stay. If you think that was a pretty awesome thing for somebody to do, then this is the place for you. For people with the right mindset, CBG is highly recommended."
2768,8110,8624066,11/9/13,9009699,Leslie,"Lisel is an excellent host, and Community Be Good is a friendly, safe, clean place to stay. There's a community fridge and kitchen, as well as easy access to the subway. For the NYC area, the place is fairly quiet inside and out. This place is for open-hearted travelers ."
2769,8110,9261340,12/16/13,4173393,Olivia,The stay was great. SO happy to have found such a host in the same neighborhood of the venue the band was performing. Lisel was a great and welcoming host.
2770,8110,13610940,6/1/14,3676098,Paul,"My wife and I stayed at Communitybegood for the month of May whilst we renovated our apartment. Lisel is a warm generous host. The house is relaxed and welcoming and very comfortable. It is in a great location close to the park and an easy commute to the city.We had a great stay."
2771,8110,18622431,8/29/14,18067085,Liz,My husbsnd and I had a wonderful stay at Lisel's. Great atmosphere and fabulous location. Lots of common space to spread out and enjoy when not sight seeing.
2772,8110,18733863,8/31/14,6883769,Kati,"The place was sooo nice! The nice brownstone with the nice colorful entry and stairs welcomes its guests from the very first moment. You feel that it's home and that a colorful, traveling, open and social person (Lisel) lives over there. You feel like part of the house and of the area when you stay there for some days. It's very centered and at the same time in one of the nices streets in Brooklyn, Park Slope. There are other nice houses around it and nice people on the street, and trees and it's nice and calm but not lonely as there are the people on the street who live there all some time. Just around the corner there is a great coffee (Gorilla Coffee) great small shops for food, fresh fruits, clothes, cute - cosy - lively - comfortable pubs, bars and cafes just 2 minutes away in 5th Street with great food, music etc. All what you need is there. You can reach the subway by foot in 5-10 minutes in all directions. In a few minutes you are directly in Manhattan or in some more minutes in other parts of New York or down at the beach. :-)A great place to stay... the house itsself as well locationwise the surroundings. The room was cozy and the bed comfortable and colorful :-) Lisel was really nice to meet and talk too! We would really recommend her great house! Plus the social issue behind it, which every person automatically donates for through paying the room :-) Thank  you Lisel and New York for welcoming us and letting us have such a great time!"

2774,8110,27310215,3/1/15,4953547,David,"Had a good few days here. After a dull few days in a chain hotel nearby, I was glad of the colour, character, perhaps a little chaos, of CommunityBeGood. Loses lovely and helpful. Location convenient for Park Slope, and close to metro into Manhattan. "
2775,8110,28768335,3/29/15,30057968,Susan,The hostess greeted me at the front door at the time I said I would come and made me feel welcome.  The neighborhood was perfect and the artwork in her home lovely.
2776,8110,32224655,5/15/15,22739354,Jenny,"Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a safe, clean and convenient place to stay in Brooklyn. The host is kind, considerate and generous. She is using her own house to do the Airbnb housing as a charitable fund-raising project for people in Haiti. In one word, if you want to have a wonderful stay and do some good deeds at the same time, just contact the host!!! "
2777,8110,39709761,7/25/15,39147650,William`,"I had a wonderful experience at this B & B.  My room was very clean and comfortable.  I appreciated the shared facilities: large, comfortable kitchen, dining room and garden seating in the yard.  The shower was large and clean.  Host Lisel was conscientious, knowledgeable, hospitable, thorough and interesting.  Her recommendations for neighborhood restaurants were helpful and on track for my interests.  I enjoyed chatting with her about her involvements in community and social action.  This was my first air bnb experience.  I usually stay in corporate hotels  when I travel for business, but this time I wanted to get a sense of the Brooklyn neighborhood - Mission accomplished.  The air bnb listing was accurate describing the facility and room.  Also, staying here, I was more able to connect with the community.  And it's true, and important, that part of the fee for your room goes as a contribution to a charity that supports redevelopment in Haiti.  So an excellent experience overall.  I'll return to this place and am encouraged to try other air bnb listings.  "

2779,8110,101854134,9/15/16,88271547,Marium,"Lisel was very hospitable. On arriving we got a tour of the place and helped us get comfortable. She gave us the keys and also a general information about the area. There were plenty of sheets, towels and other things for immediate use. We also had some interaction with guests from different parts of the world visiting NY including activists and artists. The place was clean and very close to busy Ave., where we were able to find lots of restaurants and bars. The proximity to prospect park was a great plus too. "
2780,8110,124736184,1/2/17,45748711,Shang,"Lisel is a pretty nice host and the location is super good. It's near two metro stations with all the lines you need to get to any places in Manhattan. The 5th ave nearby has so many good restaurants. You don't have a private bathroom. The shared bathrooms are clean but shampoos and body washes are almost running out. The sofa bed is more comfortable than i thought, which is good. The real bed is small and can only fit one person. "
2781,8110,150340234,5/7/17,29512867,Tim,"I'm one that is easily satisfied as long as my accommodations are clean. Unfortunately, this was not the case here. I couldn't believe the condition of the bedding. I had to find clean bedding in the bathroom and change it myself."

2785,8110,210657307,11/10/17,41101567,Carly,"Just as described, it was a cozy room in a fantastic location. Lisel and the other guests/habitants were all lovely, it was nice and quiet all the time. The location is great, lots of places to eat, hang out and explore nearby. We will be back again!"
2786,8110,213872859,11/23/17,24104008,Vasily&Aglaya,"We have chosen Lisel's place for our short NYC Thanksgiving escape. Our main consideration was Park Slope, but the social impact story behind the place also sounded attractive. It all ended as ambient and atmospheric experience in a very special home where we finally spent around 2 hours just talking to the host and sharing a Thanksgiving dinner. What I did not expect of what looked like an informal guesthouse, was a feel of ultimate home-like comfort. We even had a bathrobe! Little elements of style, paintings, books, decorations, toys for our daughter... this is why we choose airbnb when we travel! And the charity thing behind it all just adds the flavor! We will be happy to come back."
2787,8110,217931519,12/10/17,2383418,Electra,"We felt home the minute that we had stepped through the front gates! The Brownstone is in a great neighborhood! I felt as if she was ""my favorite aunt"" that I was coming to visit, as Lisel makes the space truly feel like home..... It is warm and filled with with bright colors, beautiful artwork and positive energy. Diversity, equality, and empowerment is supported!  She is an avid recycler as we are which is awesome to see! There were ""guest"" shelves with snacks/food items  that we could have.There amazing bookshelves line the walls in many different spaces, and the multitude of spiritual, personal growth, self-help, daily-meditations etc.  I am excited to book again, and plan on doing so soon! â˜®ï¸èâù_ï¸è"

2789,8110,223046862,12/31/17,48326857,Daniel,"From the moment we stepped foot into this amazing brownstone, Lisel made us feel right at home. The room was large and super comfortable. The outside temps may have been freezing, but we were cozy and warm in our peaceful surroundings. Liselâ€™s home is quiet, yet it is vibrant and full of life. Lisel goes out of her way to make sure her guests are familiarized with the ins and outs of the house, and that they feel comfortable accessing all there is to offer. She is very knowledgeable about the neighborhood as well as local  sites and transportation options. This home is run from the heart, and you feel the love when you are there."
2790,8110,270177172,5/28/18,37694722,Damon,Lisel's place was great.  Rm 2 is a nice bedroom (1 bed and a pull-out coach).  We especially enjoyed the backyard space where you can sit-out and relax.  The location is also great - close to the metro and prospect park with a lot of great restaurants near by.

2794,8110,311112805,8/20/18,6438253,Chelsea,"Lisel is very warm and welcoming, and the location is great. Unfortunately I was not aware that this is a hostel with many guests, as opposed to a single family home with one or two rooms rented out. In light of that, it didnâ€™t work for my needs, however Lisel very understanding and helpful in the cancellation process."
2795,8110,314970495,8/27/18,74538232,Cheyenne,"Lisel is an enthusiastic and helpfulness hostess who is also very passionate about her help with the Haiti fund. She gave us lots of information and printed our tickets for a festival! Would definitely stay again, the neighbourhood is great! Thanks "

Location is good to live the heart of Brooklyn and is very close to a staple like prospect park and to everything you need, like restaurants or shops; furthermore, it is a few minutes walk to the subway. Thanks!"
2797,8110,321042068,9/9/18,321050,Sophie,"Liselâ€™s place is in a GREAT location. Canâ€™t be beat. Her home has a very lived-in feel, and staying there reminded me of hostels I stayed in during various travels abroad. This place has everything you need, but isnâ€™t luxurious or overly comfortable. I was grateful for the TV and air conditioning unit and got good use out of both. When I first arrived the lock on the bedroom door was broken and the door didnâ€™t completely close, but it was fixed a few days later. Lisel seems very warm and checked in on me a few times."
2798,8110,323033331,9/14/18,35052773,Kiki,"This place is full of character a lot of art in the walls and a great supermarket just around the corner super convenient but the best part was interacting with all the other guests, all amazing people Lisels friends included! I would totally stay there again, in fact I probably will. Highly recommend it because itâ€™s also super affordable."
2799,8110,324146661,9/16/18,6802139,Don,"This is a great location for Brooklyn or even to take the subway to Manhatten. I didn't stay long enough to develop opinions about the place,but enjoyed my brief time there."

2801,8225,60454,7/3/10,150350,Timothy,Stephanie was a wonderful host. She was very knowledgeable about the city and offered great input while my wife and I were considering where to move in New York. The apartment was in a great location and the room was clean. It was very easy to find parking as well. We would recommend her accommodations to anyone.

2804,8225,112722,10/6/10,90723,Paul,"Stephanie was a very genuine lady who did her best to help as much as she could. She is a very busy person so it was sometimes a bit difficult to touch base with her.Her maison d'art appartment was very quiet, private and well appointed with a classy private (Website hidden by Airbnb) is well located to the subway and a variety of good eateries.She recommended the nearby jazz place and I was very glad she told me because I thought it was a terrific New york experience."

2811,8225,316513,6/15/11,621989,Mari,"The apartment is located in Harlem, conveniently one block from the 110th street [A, B, C] and Central Park North [2, 3] subway stations which take you to the more exciting neighborhoods such as Midtown and the Villages. As noted in the description, the apartment is located on the 4th floor and requires you to walk up very narrow flights of stairs. Hence, if you have lots of heavy luggage and/or are physically unable to walk up stairs, it may not be convenient. Note that the bathroom is shared with the guests in the other room. I did not have any difficulty with scheduling usage but if you like privacy, keep this in mind. Also, I noted a strange smell in the hallways of the apartment. If you are sensitive to these smells, you may need to hold your nose (as I had to do)."
2812,8225,370591,7/13/11,663377,Lisa,"Although we were unable to meet Stephanie as she was away on business, her husband was very accomodating and helpful. The room and amenities were as described and we had a pleasant stay at their location. Thank you again! :)"
2813,8225,407988,7/31/11,479390,Lee Ann,"Excellent location. The subway and bus were only a block from the apartment. We could get to Museum Mile in less than 20 minutes from the apartment. We arrived from Florida during a heatwave and the window air conditioner in the bedroom was a welcome relief. Sophie checked us in and made sure we were settled with maps and tour books. The apartment was clean, well kept and as advertised. "
2814,8225,424331,8/6/11,873008,Patricia,"This was a great apartment, very clean and organized. It was very helpful that Sophie had a package ready for me with maps, recommended places and a guide with events happening in NYC. I would have been lost without those guides! Great hospitality. The apartment is located on the northern part of Manhattan which is more residential and less touristy, but very close to the subway station. Great hosts, thank you so much for everything!"
2815,8225,442681,8/13/11,759660,Rene,"Had a nice few days at Stephanie's place. Stephanie was not there, but a friend/partner of hers met me and set up my visit. She was helpful and friendly as was Stephanie's husband. Slight confusion about my check in day, but it worked out with little drama. Room wasn't decorated or anything, but clean with an a/c unit, desk and comfortable bed.  Shared clean bathroom with other travelers who were also friendly. I felt comfortable with everyone there. Wifi access worked well. Location convenient to subway systems and a few businesses one avenue over. Fourth floor walkup, which was not a problem for me, but others should take note. Again, I had a good experience here. "

Stephanie's friend, Sophie, met us, gave us the keys and a tour of the apartment. She also provided maps, an events brochure and local restaurant ideas. The whole house was clean. My friend and I needed to leave our bags at the apartment after we checked out and they were very accommodating. It was a wonderful experience."
2819,8225,577432,9/28/11,869241,Erica,"Stephanie and husband were very friendly and gave lots of helpful info about the area when we got there. The room and apt were clean and pleasant.

2820,8225,587642,10/1/11,1183276,Rochelle,"Stephanie is a wonderful host, we were made to feel very welcome and comfortable for our stay in New York. Very convenient location near the subway and central park, close enough to get to Times Square in about 15 minutes but far enough out to escape the tourists when you've had enough. Stephanie has lots of knowledge about where to go and what to see in the local area, more than willing to share information but also gives you space and privacy. Would love to have had the time to explore more of Harlem itself."

2823,8225,638652,10/17/11,1249046,Derrick,"STephanie's cozy room was a major godsend for my girlfriend and i . We braved the highways and drove up from D.C. to Harlem for a reading I was a part of at NYC. We knew the hotels were super pricey and we decided to try airbnb on a whim. Best decision ever. Stephanie's friend met us with the keys once we arrived and led us to our small bedroom. Although there were other guests there, we mostly saw Stephanie, her hubby Abulai, and their cute as a button son. Great location to the subway and it was nice to be able to walk less than a few feet and end up right at the top of Central Park.We lucked out that Friday afternoon and found a great parking spot across the street and we left our car there the whole weekend with no problems or tickets.We read in one persons description that there was a weird smell in the apartment. Not true. If anything, the stairwell of the building was where the weird smell was and the apartment smelled fine.  Over all a great time was had. We didn't really use the kitchen at all or the living room space because we were out in the city during the day, but overall we felt welcomed, safe, and secure."
2824,8225,715744,11/14/11,1149432,Jose Manuel,"Stephanie's family and apartment was great, we stayed for a week at her house and it was the best. NY offers a really tiring experience and you need to have a good night's sleep to keep up with its speed, and staying at Stephanie's really made that possible. One of the best things about it was the closeness to 2 subway stations, central park is just one block to the south. Great neighborhood, very calm. Also her family was the best, her husband was really nice to us and we loved her little boy. As an extra tip you should visit her art gallery, great exhibits of artists around the world."

They were sweet and cute boys! Stephanie has lots of good information to share about sightseeing and how to get around. She is very polite and a lovely lady. We enjoyed our stay but the 3 flights of stairs with luggage or after a hard day of walking made it difficult for me. I loved the location as far as walking into Central Park. It has some beautiful trails for walking during the day. We had a hard time finding a good breakfast in the area. Just not enough good places until you get over to Broadway and thats where its all at. Thanks again Stephanie for a comfortable, private stay. Hope to see you again ."

Mizi y su familia son unas excelentes personas eso es de admirarse ya que estuvieron al pendiente desde que el aviÃ_n aterrizo, demasiado atentos, en verdad recomiendo este apartamento al 100%. La calidad humana con la que nos trato Mizi y su familia es sumamente increÃ_ble. En resumen una excelente ubicaciÃ_n, grandes personas que nos tratan como parte de su familia.

Es gab viele EinkaufsmÃ¶glichkeiten und GaststÃ_tten in der Umgebung. Stephanie war sehr freundlich und immer ansprechbar. Wir hatten viel SpaÃŸ zusammen.

While its on the 4th floor and there is many stairs to climb, we had an overall great experience. Got to share the bathroom with on other room - if the other room is booked. Thats really the only problem we faced. Whenever we tried to use the bathroom someone was almost always in there. There is an air conditioner in the room, if you stay in the warmer months. The room is comfortable for three - there is a bunk bed in the room. There is a TV - not that you'll use it. The apartment is in an amazing location. Around the corner is a deli, dunkin dounuts, and the subway which connects you to the 2 and 3 train. If you go the opposite direction there is another subway at the corner of central park which connects you to the A, C, B, and D train. Stephanie is very helpful, and patient. Expecally because we told her we'd get there at one time - but our flight ended up getting extreamly delayed. Had an amazing stay here, and would recommend it to anyone who is coming to new york."

O banheiro Ã© muito bom e o fato de dividi-lo com outros hÃ_spedes nÃ£o foi inconveniente nenhum.No primeiro dia da nossa hospedagem a Mizi nos reservou um hotel em Midtown (os hÃ_spedes anteriores precisaram ficar um dia a mais) e ela nos pagou um taxi no dia seguinte do hotel ate o apartamento.A Mizi Ã© muito atenciosa e dÃ¡ todas as dicas principalmente referente Ã s facilidades do bairro.Durante nossa hospedagem ela teve que viajar e ficou ausente por alguns dias. Neste perÃ_odo tivemos pequeno problema com a limpeza e higiene na cozinha (que Ã© uma Ã¡rea compartilhada com os demais).Mas este problema foi muito pequeno perto dos momentos maravilhosos que tivemos em NY e no apartamento.Fizemos confusÃ£o com o horario do check out e sabemos que ocasionou um transtorno com a limpeza do quarto para os proximos hÃ_spedes e agradecemos Ã  Mizi imensamente pela sua compreensÃ£o e flexibilidade."

Lots of good restaurants and very close to Tompkins Sq Park.    Subway reasonably close.  Lori was very good about communicating with us and answered all questions promptly.  Very nice
2949,8343,840780,1/6/12,387377,Marcus,"My family and I had an amazing stay in Lori's apartment over the new year, 2011/12.  I didn't know the East Village well, but it was great to live in the heart of this up-and-coming neighborhood.  The apartment is situated a few steps from a park and St Mark's Place (a very 'happening' street). The apartment is large by New York standards.  It was clean and in good condition.  It also felt safe an secure.  The kitchen was particularly nice.  It was great to have a big bathroom as well as a smaller 'half-bath'.  There was free WiFi, and a free washing machine in the basement.  Lori was also able to arrange a mid-stay cleaning, which was great for us, with five people using the bathrooms.  Lori was great to deal with and was quick to respond to all of my emails.  I love to spend time in New York and walk everywhere, but some people may find the East Village a little 'under-serviced' by subways.  It's a good 15+ minute walk to the nearest station.  But I would definitely stay here again, and have already recommended it to my friends.  Thanks Lori!"

Location a few steps up from street level (in walk-up building) was good for my elderly mother. Excellent communication with host Lori and attention to our particular needs; plenty of clear, helpful instructions. The East Village neighborhood at her doorstep offers lots of restaurants, a couple of groceries & beautiful Tomkins Square Park within very easy walking distance - also several city bus routes. An ideal, friendly base for enjoying the city!"

Lori, desde o inicio dos contatos, quis saber quantos eramos e quis nos instalar da melhor maneira possivel, o que realmente ocorreu. Ficamos com seus gatos, pois haviamos dito que gostavamos. O apto fica em um bairro tranquilo, perto de um parque e proximo a varios restaurante e uma agitada vida noturna, o que nÃ£o atrapalha a tranquilidade do apartamento. Fizemos tudo a pÃ© e com metro, sem problemas. Quando voltar a NY certamente gostaria de ficar no apto da Lori que por sinal tem uma energia muito positiva."

The surrounding neighborhood was wonderful, with plenty of interesting stores to check out and great restaurants and bars.All in all, a perfect experience, and I would not hesitate to stay again!"
2954,8343,17686888,8/16/14,10016434,Zoe,My workmates and I stayed at lori's place for 10 days. The apartment was lovely with plenty of room (although the third bedroom is very small - probably better for a child). It is in a fantastic location - lots of restaurants and bars in the surrounding streets as well as a gorgeous park just across the road. It is also very quiet - we had no problems with sleeping at all.  It was great to come home to such a peaceful place after the hustle and bustle of being out in the city. There were plenty of transport options close by - no more than 10 mins to the subway and a few different buses very nearby. I would highly recommend this apartment if you are looking for a place to stay in NY. We had a great time here. 
2955,8343,18249983,8/24/14,3329088,Victor,"In summary - a clean, spacious and brilliantly decorated flat in a convenient and quiet East Village location, with a responsive and friendly hostess.The flat is in a great location in the East Village, near the famous Katz's Delicatessen and St Mark's place (a street - the heart of the East Village), yet is tucked away in a very quiet street. It is a short walk away from a stop on the grey L metro line, but we walked most of our week in Manhattan.The flat itself is brilliant - it was unexpectedly spacious! Large dining and lounge room, including a well-stocked and modern kitchen. We hosted dinner twice in the apartment and found it to be perfect.3 bedrooms with 3 beds each was ideal for myself and 2 other friends to have a bed each.And two toilets meant no fighting!Also, just a small but cool thing - Lori has wireless speakers that can play music from an iPhone/iPod - perfect for having music on while in the flat.Lori (hostess) was very responsive and detailed in her correspondence. Also very flexible in our very late check-in and our check-out.She made our stay as comfortable as possible!Thanks for letting us enjoy your apartment for a great week in NYC!"
2956,8343,41764841,8/9/15,35341830,Michael,"Lori's home was absolutely perfect for our family of four! It was a nice, quiet respite after busy days of touring the city.  It was exactly as Lori represented, and Lori provided a manual of helpful tips for the home and surrounding area. Lori was easy to work with, super responsive, and we would plan to stay in Lori's home again if our travels bring us back to NYC."
2957,8343,58335622,1/2/16,26435777,Raul,The Apartment was very very clean and big... We had a extraordinary time in New York. Lori was very diligent ensuring all our expectations were meet. It's also very centric good bars and restaurants 
2958,8343,300215929,8/1/18,114334064,Maximilian,"We stayed at Lori's place for 10 days during the end of July. The apartment lies in a great neighbourhood, is spacious, quiet, and stayed comfortably cool despite the summer heat. Our host was very friendly, helpful and accommodating in every regard, with all amenities being provided. In short, it was a great stay. If you want to spend some time in Manhattan, this is definitely a great place to do so."
2959,8343,304468355,8/9/18,184380557,Alexandrine,"Lori answered to all our questions very fast and clearly, Rosa gived us the keys and she tooks the time to speak with us and explain us everything, both are so kind !!The district is very cute and pretty, there is a big garden just next to the flat ! The flat is big and the AC was so pleasant in the flat because it was hot outside. Everything was totally clean and beds are very confortable, definitly, this flat is a perfect place to visit and enjoy NYC !!!"
2960,8343,307589031,8/14/18,15180429,Mary Jane,"Thank you Lori for opening up your lovely home to my family and friend. Your place was perfect for the location, things to do in the neighborhood.  It truly was a quite getaway and did not seem like we were in the middle of NY city. The layout of your place was so accommodating to many people without feeling cramped, but also a nice living space to share food and company family time. Second bathroom was dreamy. We felt safe in the area and in your place. Your were a doll to leave me messages and I loved the small notes to guide us in the house. Being from Seattle, the little rain we saw did not slow us down. That said, we left two cheap rain coats in case someone could use them. I highly recommend Lori's place to friends and family.âù_ï¸è"
2961,8490,8259,8/25/09,32300,Gina,"Nathalie's brownstone truly is eden in the hood. What makes it even more special is that Nathalie is an easy going, friendly and welcoming host, who very much leaves you to it, but you can call on her any time for a chat or for help. The apartment is stunning and is beautifully decorated in an antique style, with every attention to detail. It it were a hotel, it would definitely be one of the best suites. The sunny terrace is a massive bonus, it's lovely to sit out there and have your morning coffee, while everything you might need has been thought of. It's a home from home.The neighbourhood is great, real people, friendly and helpful. There's loads to check out nearby, further down Fulton Street. When I was here there was a great art fair, and Habana Outpost, with outdoor film screenings and frozen margaritas is a must. Manhatten is a 20 minute sub ride away, but Times Square will feel so fake after you've stayed here, I guarantee it. Would highly recommend Nathalie as a host and her brownstone as a place to stay in New York. I had a wonderful time. Thanks Nathalie. "
2962,8490,16657,11/8/09,48839,J. Scott,"Our stay aw Maison Des Sirenes was enjoyable for its comfort, quietness and amenable layout. It fit our location needs for this visit with variety of amenities nearby (ie. groceries, nice wine store, subway. I would definitely return as a result and recommend it as well. On a star qualification I would rate it a 4 with a lot of value for the money."
2963,8490,18626,11/29/09,46060,Kate,"Nathalie is a fantastic host!  She was available to give us advice and directions whenever we needed them.  Maison des Sirenes is beautiful.  It feels so much like home.  The apartment is decorated eclectically, and is very clean. The kitchen is well equipped.  Nathalie has also made restaurant and site seeing guides for her guests to use.  There are plenty of maps available too.  We used the bus map a lot! Williamsburg is not too far away, and has a neat vibe to it, with yummy food and fun shopping.  We ate at Bliss and stopped into a shop called Whisk, before we went to see a show at the BAM.  We also had an amazing dinner at an Italian restaurant only a few blocks away called Saraghina.  Nathalie recommended it to us, and we loved it!  I must be honest and share that I did have concerns about the neighborhood at first because my sister and I were the minority, which is a huge switch coming from white suburbia.  However, nobody bothered us, or even gave us a sideways glance.  I think our discomfort came from our own selves.  We ended up putting our concerns aside, and walked to dinner in the evening and had a great time.  I want to thank Nathalie for being so welcoming and hospitable.  We would love to come back!"
2964,8490,20452,12/15/09,55566,Susana,"Nathalie's place is just amazing. We felt in lovewith it as soon as we saw the pics here, but what you find when you get there is even better. Nathalie is super nice and helpful if you need her but even when she lives downstairs you won't even notice her unless you search for her. The apartment is decorated just as seen in pics, but there are beautiful details that you only see once there, such as candles, cd player with relaxing music, everything you may need in kitchen and bathroom and a beautiful terrace that we'll defnetely come back to enjoy in summertime! The place is sooo charming and you can feel the good energy as soon as you go in, it's really like feeling at home!The neighborhood is save and the subway is close. While staying there we had to take a few flights and the location is just perfect for reaching the airport (by bus, subway or taxi).Thank you so much for everything Nathalie, it was a great experience and we'd definetely recommend your place to our friends."
2965,8490,39836,5/3/10,111517,Jennifer,"I visited New York for a weekend with three friends and we were instantly smitten with Nathalie's gorgeous home. It's spacious (plenty of room for four people), convenient, and above all, replete with personality and character. Throughout the trip, my friends and I remarked countless times how glad we were to be staying at Nathalie's place in Brooklyn; not only did we get to see interesting neighbourhoods many tourists never experience, returning to Maison des Sirenes at the end of the day always felt like going home. There were thoughtful touches or details in every corner - a hairdryer and towels were provided, the kitchen was stocked with pots/pans/utensils, binders were stuffed with restaurant recommendations. The terrace was also marvelous - perfect for winding down at the end of a long day in the city.Nathalie is a lovely host too. We were stuck in traffic while driving to NYC and arrived hours late -- at 3 a.m.! -- and Nathalie remained ever gracious and friendly, staying up to welcome us. I feel really lucky for finding Nathalie and her apartment and I would be more than happy to stay there on any return visits. I recommend it wholeheartedly - thank you so much Nathalie!"
2966,8490,48802,6/1/10,105648,Jocelyne,The apartment is warm and cosy. Travelling from there to Manhattan is very easy. Nathalie leaves recommandations and reviews to her guests. Really helpful!
2967,8490,61598,7/6/10,104152,Johanna,Me and my friend Veronica stayed for a week in Nathalies lovely appartement! We had a perfect stay and Nathalie was helpful and kind. The terrace was lovely for a cold beer in the late summernight or for an early breakfast! I will absolutely recommend this appartement for my friends! Johanna 
2968,8490,78220,8/14/10,151067,Maranda,"Amazing time...Her place is so cute and has everything you needLove the neighborhood will definitely go back next time I'm in NY..Saranghina the italien restaurant around the corner is amazing a real pearl in the hood..: ) I  loved everything about my stay at Natalie..."
2969,8490,110959,10/4/10,184560,Nadene,"The apartment is beautiful.  Nathalie is kind and gracious.  The neighborhood is so amazing.  (My two girlfriends and I came to New York with no plans - just to relax.  Three 50 year old white women wandering around the neighborhood.)  We did not meet one person that was not friendly and welcoming. There are little stores and any kind of food you desire.  We took the subway to Manhattan (I definitely recommend the Carnegie Deli - split the order with someone!!)  It was so nice to come back to Maison Des Sirenes at the end of the day and relax.  The Italian Resturant in the next block is not to be missed (Website hidden by Airbnb) While this is not the normal ""bed and breakfast"" experience of having someone spoil you - I will recommend this place to everyone. What a wonderful adventure.  Thank you Nathalie!!  Dee, Linda and Julie"
2970,8490,302719,6/7/11,32006,Stephane,"Nathalie apartment was so lovely! It was clean, beautiful and had all the necessities for a short stay, and we really enjoyed exploring Brooklyn and Manhattan and then coming ""home"" to a comfortable and airy place to relax, especially the terrace. It was easy to navigate the subways to her neighborhood, and the neighborhood felt very safe, even coming home late. Also It is important to mention, Nathalie is reliable and always available.I highly recommend her apartment."
2971,8490,316453,6/15/11,633882,Araba,"Nathalies apartment was beautiful and extremely clean. You can tell that she enjoys hosting visitors.   We enjoyed the roof terrace and were blessed with some lovely weather although with all of the things we wanted to do could not spend enough time there!  Nathalie is very helpful and has a lot of information on where to go and things to do in New York.  I would definitely return there.  Thank you Nathale for making our stay enjoyable.  "
2972,8490,456780,8/18/11,953617,Thomas,"The overall experience at Nathalie's was a good one.  It was very spacious (enough for 3 beds), clean, and quite convenient to Manhattan.  Other pluses: she had binders full of good reading material about NYC, Direct TV with tons of channels including premium channels like HBO, and a great terrace to unwind from the day.  All of which would make me not hesitate to stay at her place again!  There were some minor issues though:  The bath tub (despite being clean) is a ""bend down and spray"" tub which made showering in the morning a bit annoying.  During the day, the area feels very safe but late at night it can be a bit dodgy.  We had a drunk guy follow us after we got out of the subway begging us to buy him a beer.  I suppose this could happen anywhere in NYC.  All in all, though I would rate my first airbnb experience a good one.  Thanks Nathalie!!"
2973,8490,524379,9/12/11,994376,Whitney,"The apartment was beautiful, spacious and comfortable. It was much more convienent than a hotel. We had one small issue with the toilet overflowing, but Nathalie was responsive and helpful. I appreciated the travel guides that Nathalie created. The neighborhood was welcoming, but a long walk from areas that we were interested in shopping and eating at. "

There was nothing that I was in need of that wasn't there, I even found a socket adapter.If I were ever to return to New York, Nathalie would be my first contact."
2975,8490,705218,11/9/11,1100161,Daniela,"First I liked the appartment a lot, second I liked Nathalie and her family a lot and third I liked the neighborhood very much, too. So what else is there still to say? ;-)The bed has just the right tightness to provide a great sleep, the terrace has a cool urban vibe, the kitchen full of useful things, the decoration is romantic and shabby chic and I personally loved the speedy WIFI-connection - combined with the special atmosphere and nostalgic charme of the whole house it is a perfect place for a pleasant New York stay."

J'y ai bien dormi, apprÃ©ciÃ© l'air climatisÃ©e pendant cette chaleur estivale et dÃ©couvert un quartier intÃ©ressant. La rue Lewis a plusieurs petits commerces vraiment chouettes.

It was very well decorated, very clean and had everything we could ask for during our brief stay.  I could tell she put a good amount of effort into setting up the apartment to be both visually appealing and functional for her guests.Nathalie provided very detailed instructions on how to travel to and access the apartment and gave several good recommendations for local places to shop and eat.   The apartment was just a short 10 minute walk from the subway station and we came and went even late into the night with no worries or issues.  I highly recommend staying with Nathalie if you get a chance.

2986,8490,5351769,6/25/13,2832484,Beth,"The apartment was very spacious, with high ceilings and room to relax after a busy day in the city. The twin daybeds were quite comfortable even for one person in our party who has a bad back, The A/C was great, only a window unit but kept the entire apartment nice and cool. My in-laws very much enjoyed their mornings on the patio. The neighborhood was also great. I felt safe even as our group was returning after dark. There was plenty of street parking nearby."
2987,8490,7593570,9/25/13,523603,Eve,"Natalie was a lovely host, easy to work with and has everything set up for easy check in and check out.

Open up a warm, cozy, personable and charming place to stay.  Nathalie's apartment is 5 star!  I loved the beds, the decor, the east  coast woodwork.  The cool patio in back.  Tub and shower were great.  I met Nathalie, and she was superb. Look no further this is the spot.  Its close to the train.  Never felt unsafe.  And of course, its NY, so you can find some really good food in walking distance.  "

She left us very clear instructions on everything about the apartment and was very gracious.  The place was absolutely wonderful, clean, charming, and very beautiful in its historic details,  furnishings and international decor.  We felt warm and cozy on the rainy cold days we stayed there in December.  Our elderly mother was very comfortable and it meant so much to her to have a place where her family could gather.  The kitchen was well stocked with everything needed.  The light and layout of the apartment was excellent, and the backyard upper deck was beautiful and private feeling, like the rest of the apartment.  We would have enjoyed using it had the weather been better.  The pictures show the place very well, but the details of the two fireplace mantel pieces, the old plaster moldings, the wood work and chandeliers were wonderful to see. All in all, a great place for us to land for our family gathering in a perfect neighborhood.  We are very grateful, Nathalie!"

There was lots of room for the three of us friends, especially when Nathalie made an extra effort to make sure our tall friend had a double bed. The patio is a lovely addition. The neighbourhood is a bit ""up and coming,"" but we had zero issues there and completely enjoyed our stay. I recommend the little organic food shop on the corner of Throop and Halsey, I believe it was. Make sure to check out Brunswick cafe on Marcus Garvey Blvd for coffee or brunch! "
