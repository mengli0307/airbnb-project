(shun and akiko, here is my one important suggestion:  go to ikea or bed, bath & beyond (or even jcpenney) and get a set of matching sheets, duvet / comforter cover and - matching pillows and pillowcases.  the sheets,  and especially the pillows,  were sub-standard even at your very competitive rate.  if you do this, you would definitely earn -stars from me!  thanks again for a fantastic stay overall!  you guys were wonderful!!\",\n",
